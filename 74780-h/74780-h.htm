<h3>PARLOUR EDITION OF MISS BRADDON’S NOVELS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>In handy size, crown 8vo, printed in large, easily-read type, with Frontispiece
on toned paper, handsomely bound in cloth, gilt back, lettered, price
3s. 6d. each.</i></p>

<p>The popularity and success of Miss Braddon’s Novels are facts well known to
every Bookseller in the kingdom. Both in the Library Edition, at Six Shillings
per work, and in the Cheap Edition, at Two Shillings per work, the sales of Miss
Braddon’s productions attest an extent of public appreciation alike without precedent
and without parallel. The Book Trade is well aware of this; and it is
also well aware of the desire frequently expressed by customers for an Edition
less expensive than the Library, and more legible than the Cheap Edition of
their favourite Author. To meet this requirement, the Publishers beg to announce
a Parlour Edition of Miss Braddon’s Novels, each work got up in excellent
style, printed on good paper, in a clear and easily-read type, serviceably
bound in cloth, gilt back, lettered, forming not merely an intermediate issue, so
far as price is concerned, but also about the most substantial, the neatest, and
the handiest series of books that the most fastidious of economists can procure.
After the first month, the New Edition will be issued Monthly, each volume
containing an entire Novel.</p>

ILLUSTRIOUS DR. MATHÉUS.</h2>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h3>

</div>

<p>In the little woodland town of Graufthal, on the
borders of the Vosges and of Alsace, there lived one of
those respectable rural doctors who still wore perruques,
large square-tailed coats, knee-breeches, and silver-buckled
shoes.</p>

<p>This worthy man was named Frantz Mathéus. He
inherited from his ancestors the oldest house in the
place, an orchard, some arable land on the mountain,
a few acres of meadow in the valley; and if you add
to this modest patrimony eggs, milk, cheese, and, from
time to time, a lean fowl, sent to the Doctor by the
honest peasants out of the fulness of their gratitude,
you will have the whole of Maître Frantz’s income: it
sufficed for his maintenance and that of his old servant
Martha, as well as his horse Bruno.</p>

<p>Maître Frantz was a curious type of the old <i>doctores
medicinæ</i>, <i>theologiæ</i> or <i>philosophiæ</i> of the good German
school. His face expressed the gentlest placidity, the
most perfect good-nature; his ruling passion was metaphysics.
The same pleasure which you, I imagine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
might take in reading <i>Candide</i> or <i>The Sentimental
Journey</i>, he experienced in meditating the <i>Tractatus
Theologico-politicus</i> of Baruch Spinosa, or the <i>Monadologie</i>
of Leibnitz. He also made experiments in
physics and chemistry for his own amusement.</p>

<p>Having one day put some flour of ergot-rye into a
bottle of water, he perceived, at the end of a month or
two, that his rye had given birth to a number of little
eels, which speedily produced a crowd of others.
Mathéus, transported with enthusiasm at this discovery,
at once concluded from it that if eels can be
made with rye-flour, men may be made with the flour
of wheat. But after reflecting more on the subject
the learned Doctor thought that this transformation
must be effected slowly—progressively; that from rye
would come eels—from eels fish of all kinds; from
these fishes, reptiles, quadrupeds, birds, and so on, up
to man inclusive—the whole by virtue of the law of
progress. He called this progression “the ladder of
being;” and as he had studied Greek, Latin, and
several other languages, he set himself to compose a
magnificent work, in sixteen volumes, entitled, <i>Palingenesis-Psychologico-Anthropo-Zoology</i>,
explaining spontaneous
generation, the transformation of bodies, and
the peregrination of souls; citing Brahma, Vishnu,
Siva, Isis and Osiris, Thales of Miletus, Heraclitus,
Democritus—in short, all the cosmological philosophers,
both ancient and modern.</p>

<p>He sent several copies of this work to the German
universities, and what was more astonishing, a good
number of philosophers adopted his system; titles were
conferred on him of Corresponding Member of the
Surgical Institution of Prague, of the Royal Society of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Sciences of Gœttingen, and of Veterinary Councillor of
the Stud of Wurtzbourg.</p>

<p>Mathéus, encouraged by these tokens of appreciation,
resolved to bring out a second edition of his <i>Palingenesis</i>,
enriched with notes in Hebrew and Syriac in elucidation
of the text.</p>

<p>But his old servant—a woman of great sense—represented
to him that this glorious enterprise had already
cost him half of all he was worth; and that he would
be obliged to sell his horse, his orchard, and his meadows,
to print his Syriac notes. She begged him to think a
little more of mundane matters, and to moderate his
anthropo-zoological ardour.</p>

<p>These judicious considerations greatly vexed Maître
Frantz, but he could not help seeing that the good
woman was right; he sighed deeply, and kept his aspirations
after glory to himself.</p>

<p>Now all this had happened a long time ago. Mathéus
had returned to his habitual mode of life; he mounted
his horse early in the morning to go and visit his
patients; he returned late, harassed with fatigue; in
the evening, instead of shutting himself up in his
library, he went down into the garden to prune his
vine, to clear his trees of caterpillars, and to hoe his
lettuces; after supper, Jean-Claude Wachtmann the
schoolmaster, Christian the <i>garde champêtre</i>, and a few
gossips of the neighbourhood with their spinning-wheels
dropped in. They all sat round a table, and
chatted about the weather, Mathéus entertaining them
with news of his patients; and, at nightfall, he went
tranquilly to bed, to recommence on the morrow.</p>

<p>Thus passed the days, months, and years. But this
peaceful mode of existence could not console Maître<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Frantz for having missed his vocation. Often, in his
distant rides, alone in the midst of the woods, he reproached
himself for his fatal inaction: “Frantz,” he
said to himself, “Graufthal is not the place for you!
All those whom the Being of beings has made depositaries
of the treasures of science belong to humanity.
What will you answer to that Great Being when the
time for rendering an account of yourself shall have
come? Will He not say to you, in a voice of thunder:
‘Frantz Mathéus, I had gifted you with the most
magnificent intelligence, I had unveiled to you things
divine and human, I had destined you from the beginning
of time to spread the lights of sound philosophy;
where are your works? In vain for you to try to
excuse yourself on the plea of its being necessary for
you to attend to the sick; these vulgar duties were not
made for you; others would have filled your place.
Go, Frantz, go; you were not worthy of the confidence
I placed in you, and I condemn you to redescend the
ladder of being!’”</p>

<p>Sometimes even the good soul woke himself in the
middle of the night with crying out, “Frantz! Frantz!
you are highly culpable!”</p>

<p>His old servant would rush to his bedside in alarm,
exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Good heavens! what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“It is nothing—it is nothing,” Mathéus would
answer; “I have had a bad dream—that’s all.”</p>

<p>This moral condition of the illustrious doctor could
not endure for ever; the repression of his metaphysical
tendencies was too severe.</p>

<p>One evening, as he was returning to the village along
the bank of the Zinsel, he met one of those hawkers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
bibles and almanacs who make their way even to the
tops of the mountains to sell their wares. Maître
Frantz had not lost the taste for worm-eaten books;
he dismounted, and looked over the hawker’s stock.
By the merest chance this one possessed a copy of the
<i>Anthropo-Zoology</i>, which he had not been able to dispose
of for fifteen years; and, seeing Mathéus regard
this work with a thoroughly paternal love, he did not
fail to tell him that nothing sold better than that, that
everybody wanted to read this book, that no more
copies were to be had, and that in consequence of this
great demand the work was every day becoming more
rare.</p>

<p>Maître Frantz’s heart beat strongly, his hand trembled.</p>

<p>“Oh, Great Demiourgos! Great Demiourgos!” he
murmured to himself; “here I recognise thine infinite
wisdom. Out of the mouths of the simple thou recallest
the sages to their duties!”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz returned to Graufthal in a state of
extreme agitation: he went about vaguely; a crowd of
incoherent ideas pressed upon his mind. Should he go
and live at Gœttingen? Should he go to Prague?
Ought he to reprint the <i>Palingenesis</i> with new notes?
Or ought he to apostrophise the age on its indifference
to the subject of anthropo-zoology?</p>

<p>All this tormented, distressed him; but the means
appeared to him too long, and his impatience admitting
of no delay, he resolved to follow the example of the
old prophets—to go forth himself into the universe and
preach his own doctrine.</p>

</div>

<p>When Frantz Mathéus had formed the generous resolve
of illuminating the world with his own light, a
strange and undefinable calm entered into the depths
of his soul. It was the eve of St. Boniface, towards
six o’clock in the evening; a splendid sun lit the valley
of Graufthal, and relieved the motionless branches of
the tall firs against the clear sky.</p>

<p>The good man was seated in the old arm-chair of his
forefathers, near the small casement, his eyes wandering
over the silent little town stretched at the foot of
the misty mountains.</p>

<p>Peasants were mowing grass on the skirt of the
forest; women, old Martha herself amongst them,
armed with rakes, were turning the hay and singing
old country airs.</p>

<p>The Zinsel murmured softly in its pebbly bed; a low
hum filled the air; long files of ducks were taking their
way up the stream, and every now and then raised their
nasal cry; fowls were sleeping under the shadow of
walls, on the shafts of carts and implements of labour;
chubby children were romping and amusing themselves
on the thresholds of cottages; and watchdogs, their
muzzles between their paws, gave themselves up to the
overpowering heat of the day.</p>

<p>This calm scene insensibly touched the heart of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Mathéus; silent tears stole down his venerable cheeks;
he took his already grey head between his hands, and,
with his elbows on the window-ledge, wept like a
child.</p>

<p>A crowd of tender recollections rose to his mind.
That rustic dwelling, the abode of his father—this
little garden, the trees of which he had cultivated,
every plant in which he had sown—this old oak furniture,
embrowned by time—all reminded him of his
peaceful happiness, his habits, his friends, his infancy;
and it almost seemed as if each of those inanimate
objects appealed to him in touching accents not to desert
them—reproached him for his ingratitude, and
commiserated him beforehand on his loneliness in the
world. And the heart of Frantz Mathéus echoed all
these voices, and at every recollection fresh tears
streamed more abundantly from his eyes.</p>

<p>Then, when he thought of the poor little town of
which he was in some sort the only providence; when,
through his tears, he looked at each of the little doors
at which he had so often stopped to speak words of
consolation, to distribute help, and to give ease to
human sufferings; when he remembered all the hands
that had pressed his, all the looks of affection and love
that had blessed him—then he felt the weight of his
resolution almost more than he could bear, and dared
not think of the moment of his departure.</p>

<p>“What will Christian Schmidt say,” he thought,
“whose wife I cured of a cruel malady, and who does
not know how sufficiently to show his gratitude to me?
What will Jacob Zimmer say, whom I saved from ruin,
when he had not a farthing left to rebuild his barn?
What will old Martha say, who has taken care of me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
with a mother’s tenderness, who brought me my coffee
and cream every morning, who mended my breeches
and stockings, and who would never go to bed till she
had covered me up and pulled my cotton nightcap down
to my ears? Poor Martha!—poor, poor, good old
Martha! Only yesterday she was knitting me warm
under-stockings, and putting away the dozen new shirts
she had spun for me with her own hands! And what
will Georges Brenner say, on hearing that his wood
will be burnt by somebody else? He’ll be very angry;
he’s a man of the canine race, who will not listen to
reason, and will not let me go.”</p>

<p>Such were the reflections of Frantz Mathéus; and
if his resolution had not been firm, indestructible, so
many obstacles would have overthrown his courage.</p>

<p>But as the sun went down towards the Falberg, and
the coolness of night spread itself over the bottom of
the valley, he felt calmness and serenity revive within
his soul; his eyes rose lovingly towards heaven, the last
rays of twilight illuminating his inspired brow; he
might have been thought to be praying silently. Frantz
Mathéus was thinking of the incalculable consequences
of his system for the happiness of future men, and
nothing but Martha’s arrival could interrupt the flow
of his sublime meditations.</p>

<p>He heard his old servant go into the kitchen, put
away her rake behind the door, and begin to take down
plates and dishes preparatory to supper.</p>

<p>These sounds, familiar to his ear; Martha’s tread,
which he would have recognised among a thousand; the
hum of the little town, the song of the men and women
haymakers returning merrily home, the small windows
in which lights were appearing one by one—all this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
once more affected the good man; he dared not stir
from his seat; with joined hands and head bent down,
he listened to these intermingled sounds. “Listen to
these beloved sounds,” he said to himself, “for perhaps
you may never hear them again!—never!”</p>

<p>Suddenly Martha opened the room-door. She could
not see her master, and called out—</p>

<p>“Are you there, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Martha, I am here,” answered Mathéus, in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Bless us! why do you sit in the dark like that? I’ll
run and get a light.”</p>

<p>“There is no need. I would rather speak to you so.
I would rather tell you—— Come—come here and
listen to me.”</p>

<p>Mathéus could not articulate another word; his heart
beat violently, and he thought: “If I were to see her
face when I tell her what I must tell her—it would be
more than I could bear.”</p>

<p>Martha felt by the Doctor’s tone of voice that she
was going to hear distressing news, and her knees bent
under her.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Doctor?” she said;
“your voice trembles!”</p>

<p>“It is nothing—it is nothing, my good, my dear
Martha!—it is nothing. Sit down—here, near me; I
have something to tell you——”</p>

<p>But again the words died upon his lips.</p>

<p>After a few moments’ silence, he went on—</p>

<p>“It will distress you, but it must be done.”</p>

<p>The old servant in great anxiety hurried away to fetch
the lamp; when she returned she saw Mathéus looking
as pale as death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“You are ill, Doctor,” she cried; “you are in pain,
I am sure!”</p>

<p>But the illustrious Doctor had had time to collect
his thoughts. A luminous idea flashed upon his
mind—</p>

<p>“If I can succeed in convincing Martha, all will go
well, and it will clearly prove besides that entire
humanity will be unable to resist the eloquence of Frantz
Mathéus.” Full of this conviction, he rose.</p>

<p>“Martha,” he said, “look me full in the face.”</p>

<p>“I’m looking at you, Doctor,” replied the bewildered
old servant.</p>

<p>“Well, you see before you Frantz Mathéus, Doctor
of Medicine of the Faculty of Strasbourg, Corresponding
Member of the Surgical Institute of Prague and of the
Royal Society of Sciences of Gœttingen, Veterinary
Councillor of the Stud of Wurtzbourg, and formerly,
by a truly frightful concourse of circumstances, Surgeon-Major
to the band of Schinderhannes.”</p>

<p>Here the Doctor paused, to allow Martha time to
appreciate the full magnificence of these titles. He
then went on—</p>

<p>“Frantz Mathéus, sole inventor of the famous psychologico-anthropo-zoological
doctrine, which has shaken
the world, astounded ignorance, exasperated envy, and
struck the universe with admiration! Frantz Mathéus,
to whom have been entrusted the destinies of humanity
and of cosmological philosophy, founded on the three
kingdoms of nature—vegetable, animal, and human!
Frantz Mathéus, who for fifteen years has languished
in shameful ease, and whose indignant conscience every
day reproaches him with having abandoned to the
hazard of systems, to the sophisms of schools, and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the disastrous influence of prejudice, the future of
humankind!”</p>

<p>Martha trembled in every limb; never had she seen
her master in such a state of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher, on his side, marked with
satisfaction his servant’s bewilderment. He went on
with redoubled eloquence—</p>

<p>“How long, Mathéus, will you take upon yourself
this frightful responsibility? How long will you forget
the sublime mission imposed on you by genius? Do
you not hear the voices calling you? Do you not know
that, to mount the ladder of being, one must suffer,
and that to suffer is to merit? Ignorance and sophistry
raise themselves in vain against you? March—march!
Frantz Mathéus! Sow on your way the beneficent
germs of anthropo-zoology, and your glory, immortal
as truth, shall grow from age to age, sheltering beneath
its evergreen foliage the future generations! It is for
this purpose, Martha, that you must pack up my valise
this evening; tell Nickel, the cobbler, to mend Bruno’s
saddle; give a double feed of oats to the poor beast;
and I shall set off to-morrow before daybreak, to preach
my doctrine to the universe.”</p>

<p>At this conclusion Martha was very nearly tumbling
backwards; she thought her master had gone out
of his senses.</p>

<p>“What, Doctor!” she stammered; “you want to
leave us—to abandon us? Oh, no! it’s impossible!
You—so good—who have none but friends in the place!
You can’t think of such a thing!”</p>

<p>“It must be so,” replied Mathéus stoically—“it
must be so; it is my duty.”</p>

<p>Martha said no more, and appeared to resign herself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
As usual, she laid the cloth and served up the
Doctor’s supper. That day it was a fowl with rice, and
filberts for dessert; Mathéus—of the family of the nibblers—was
very fond of nuts. His servant redoubled
her usual attentions; she herself carved the fowl, and
assisted him to the most delicate morsels; she refilled
his glass to the brim, and looked at him with a melancholy
eye, as if in pity.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, she conducted Mathéus
into his little bedroom, turned the bedclothes down
herself, and satisfied herself that his cotton nightcap
was under the pillow.</p>

<p>All was white, clean, neatly arranged; the china
washhand-basin on the stand, the ewer of fresh water
in the basin, the little glass shining between the two
windows; the bookcase, containing the <i>Anthropo-Zoology</i>,
in sixteen volumes, some Latin authors, and books of
medicine carefully dated; everywhere might be recognised
the attentive care of the vigilant housewife.</p>

<p>After having convinced herself that everything was in
its place, Martha opened the door and wished her master
“good night” in a voice so touching that the illustrious
philosopher felt heartrent. He would have liked
to have thrown himself upon the excellent woman’s
neck, and said to her, “Martha—my good Martha—you
cannot imagine how much Frantz Mathéus admires
your courage and resignation. He predicts for
you the highest future destiny!” That is what he
would have liked to have said; but fear of a too pathetic
scene calmed his deep emotion, and he contented himself
by again gently enjoining her to give a double feed
of oats to Bruno, and to wake him at daybreak.</p>

<p>The good woman went slowly away, and the illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Doctor Mathéus, happy in this first triumph, lay
down in his feather-bed.</p>

<p>For a long time he could not close an eye; he recapitulated
all the events of this memorable day, and
the sublime consequences of the anthropo-zoological
system; images, invocations, prosopopœia, linked themselves
one with another in his luminous mind, until at
last his eyelids drooped, and he sank into a profound
sleep.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h3>

</div>

<p>The pale rays of dawn were dimly lighting the little
town of Graufthal when Frantz Mathéus opened his
eyes; the red cock of his neighbour Christina Bauer
awoke him with its matutinal crow at the moment
when Socrates and Pythagoras were placing crowns of
imperishable flowers upon his head.</p>

<p>This happy omen put him immediately into a good
humour. He pulled on his breeches, and opened his
window to breathe the free air. But judge of his surprise
when he discovered, a few steps from the door,
Jean-Claude Wachtmann, the schoolmaster, pacing to
and fro, a paper in his hand, and making truly extraordinary
gestures.</p>

<p>What increased the Doctor’s astonishment was to
see that Jean-Claude had on his large Sunday coat,
and that he wore his immense three-cornered hat and
silver-buckled shoes.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here so early in the morning,
Maître Claude?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am reading,” replied the schoolmaster gravely,
without disturbing himself; “I am reading a piece of
eloquence composed by myself—something to soften
the heart of a rock!”</p>

<p>The gesture, the attitude, and the imposing look of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Jean-Claude portended trouble to the soul of Frantz
Mathéus; he began to conceive vague uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Maître Claude,” he said in a faltering voice, “I
am not unaware of your talents and remarkable learning;
will you have the kindness to let me look at this
discourse?”</p>

<p>“You shall hear it, Doctor—you shall hear it, when
the others are assembled,” replied Claude Wachtmann,
putting his paper into the large pocket of his black
coat; “it is before everybody I wish to read this remarkable
work, the fruit of my studies and of my profound
sorrow.”</p>

<p>The schoolmaster’s look was august as he pronounced
these words, and Frantz Mathéus felt himself
turn pale.</p>

<p>“Martha! Martha!” he murmured to himself, “what
have you done? Not content with shaking my courage
by your tears, you still further take advantage of my
being asleep to raise the village against me!”</p>

<p>Alas! the illustrious Doctor had not deceived himself;
his perfidious servant had given the note of warning,
and the report of his departure had spread far
and wide.</p>

<p>Georges Brenner, the woodman, soon made his appearance.
He cast a savage look towards the Doctor’s
house, and clapped himself down on the stone bench by
the door; then came Christian, the thresher, every
feature expressing dejection; then Katel Schmidt, the
miller’s sister; then all the village, women, children,
old folks, as if to a funeral.</p>

<p>Mathéus, hidden behind his windows, shuddered on
seeing the gathering storm. His first idea was to confront
this ignorant crowd, entirely destitute of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
simplest notions on the subject of the three kingdoms
of nature—to make them blush for their narrow selfishness,
by demonstrating in the most evident manner
that Frantz Mathéus owed himself to the universe, and
that his sublime genius could not bury itself at Graufthal
without committing a terrible crime towards
humankind; but afterwards his natural prudence suggested
to his mind a less imposing project, though one
that was quite legitimate, and requiring tact for its
execution: he resolved to go softly into the kitchen,
from the kitchen into the barn, then to saddle Bruno
and escape by the back-door.</p>

<p>This ingenious design made the good man smile; he
pictured to himself Maître Claude’s stupefaction in
thinking to catch the hare in its form when it was already
trotting far away over the mountain.</p>

<p>Hastily he put on a pair of new woollen stockings,
his big brown overcoat, and his heavy riding-boots,
furnished with spurs like clock-wheels; then he put on
his wide-brimmed hat, which gave him a venerable appearance,
and opened his door with infinite caution.
But, in crossing the kitchen, he fortunately recollected
the <i>Anthropo-Zoology</i>, and returned in haste to put the
synopsis in his pocket.</p>

<p>The illustrious Doctor regretted not being able to
take with him the sixteen quarto volumes, but he
carried in his head all the developments of that great
work, as well as the notes, corollaries, references, and a
mass of unpublished and curious observations, the results
of his later studies.</p>

<p>At last, after a farewell look at his cherished library,
he stole, all in a tremble, into the stable, like a captive
escaping from the hands of infidels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Broad daylight already made its way in through the
dull panes of a skylight, and the sight of Bruno revived
his courage.</p>

<p>Bruno was a vigorous horse, with massive neck and
shoulders, wide chest; short, solid, thick-set, with firm
hocks; in a word, the worthy and robust bearer of the
country Doctor.</p>

<p>On seeing Maître Mathéus go by on Bruno, every one
might have said—</p>

<p>“There go the very best beast and the greatest philosopher
in the country.”</p>

<p>Frantz Mathéus saw, by his shining and well-rounded
paunch, that he had eaten his double feed of oats;
therefore, without dissertation of any sort, he put on
his large leathern saddle, in one of the holsters of which
he placed the copy of his synopsis; then, with a precipitation
which proved his great desire to escape
Claude Wachtmann’s eloquence, he led his horse into
the barn, raised the bar, and opened the folding-door.</p>

<p>But the anger and exasperation of the Doctor are not
to be imagined when he saw the whole village gathered
about the door, Jean-Claude Wachtmann at the head,
Hubert the blacksmith on his right, and Christian
Bauer on his left. His venerable face turned suddenly
red, and his habitually calm and meditative eyes shot
forth the lightnings of a noble indignation.</p>

<p>He mounted abruptly into the saddle, crying—</p>

<p>“Make way!”</p>

<p>But the crowd did not stir, and Maître Frantz even
thought he could perceive a mocking smile on all their
lips, as if defying him to go.</p>

<p>“Come, my friends, make way for me,” he said, in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
less decided tone; “I am going to see my patients in
the mountain.”</p>

<p>This falsehood, so contrary to his system, pained him;
yet the peasants, who knew his goodness, took no heed
of it.</p>

<p>“We know all,” cried fat Catherine, pretending to
shed tears in her apron, “we know all! Martha has
told us all—you want to leave the village.”</p>

<p>Mathéus was going to reply, when Jean-Claude
Wachtmann, with a single wave of his hand, imposed
silence on everybody; he then planted himself in front
of the Doctor to overpower him by his looks, majestically
drew forth his spectacles from their case, pressed
them down upon his big nose, smoothed out his paper
with a grave air, once more looked around him to command
the attention of the crowd, and began to read
the following masterpiece in a solemn tone, pausing at
the commas and full-stops, and gesticulating like a
very preacher:—</p>

<p>“When the great Antiochus, Emperor of Nineveh
and Babylon, formed the ambitious design of departing
from his kingdom to make the conquest of the five
quarters of the world, with the guilty view of covering
himself with laurels, his friend Cineas said to him:
‘Great Antiochus, worthy scion of so many kings,
Emperor of Babylon, of Nineveh, and of Mesopotamia,
a country situate between the Tigris and the
Euphrates—magnanimous and invincible warrior!
deign to lend an ear to the touching words of your
friend Cineas, a man of intelligence, who prostrates
himself before you, and who can give you none but the
best advice. What is glory, Antiochus?—what is
glory? An empty smoke, like a dense shadow that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
has not the least body to support it. Glory!—the
scourge of humanity, bearing with it plague, war,
famine, shame and desolation! What! illustrious
Antiochus, would you abandon your wife, an august
queen full of virtues, and your poor children, who
wring their hands and cover themselves with ashes?
What! can you have a soul so hardened and perverse
as to plunge into an abyss of desolation this people
that adores you, these nubile women, these mature
men, these infants at the breast, and these old men
with locks white as the snow of Mount Ida, of whom
you are as it were the father! You hear their cries—their
tears—their——’”</p>

<p>He could not proceed any further; the crowd, as with
one assent, suddenly burst into tears; the women
sobbed, the men sighed, the children squalled, and the
whole house was filled with lamentations.</p>

<p>At that moment Claude Wachtmann raised himself
upon the point of his toes, and moved his big nose from
right to left to assure himself that each one was doing
his duty. He caught sight of Jacques Burrus’s little
incorrigible, who, having climbed upon the barn-ladder,
was holding old Mathéus’ grey cat by the tail and
making the poor brute squall dolefully. He made a
sign with his finger to the young rascal, who, recollecting
his instructions, set to crying with all his might.</p>

<p>Claude Wachtmann then enjoyed his triumph, for
never had the like been heard before.</p>

<p>The face of Frantz Mathéus expressed consternation;
however, when he heard Cineas speak to the great
Antiochus, an imperceptible smile spread over his lips;
he moved forward a step, so as to bring the head of
Bruno outside of the circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Jean-Claude raised his hand, and everybody became
silent as if by enchantment.</p>

<p>“Illustrious Doctor Mathéus,” he continued, “in
like manner with the inhabitants of Babylon——”</p>

<p>But at the same instant Frantz Mathéus, without
waiting for the end, drove both spurs into Bruno, who
bounded off like a storm, through hedges, over gardens,
crops, bushes; crushing the cabbages of one, the
turnips of another, the barley of this one, the oats of
that—in short, as if the deuce were in him.</p>

<p>The cries of the crowd pursued him; but the Doctor
did not even turn his head, and was soon across the
large communal meadow.</p>

<p>Jean-Claude’s face was as lank and yellow as a wax
candle. He raised his long arms and cried—</p>

<p>“I have not finished! I have not yet read the passage
of Nebuchadnezzar changed into an ox with the
plumes of an eagle for his pride! Listen, Jacques—Herbert—Christian!”</p>

<p>But nobody would listen; the whole village was on
the track of Mathéus, shouting, hissing, the dogs barking,
as if the end of the world had come.</p>

<p>Very soon they saw the Doctor mount the Falberg at
a gallop; he had crossed the Zinsel swimming, and
was holding on to Bruno’s neck, the tails of his coat
flying in the air from the speed at which he was
going.</p>

<p>At length he disappeared in the woods, and the
peasants looked at one another aghast.</p>

<p>Jean-Claude greatly wanted to return to the continuation
of his beautiful discourse, but everybody turned
their backs upon him, saying—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the use of your discourse since we have lost
our Doctor? Ah! if we had only thought of it, some
one might have held him by the bridle!”</p>

<p>It was thus that the illustrious Doctor Frantz
Mathéus, thanks to his heroic resolution, to his presence
of mind, and to the vigorous legs of Bruno, succeeded
in recovering his independence.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

</div>

<p>His delight may be imagined when he saw himself
safe from Jean-Claude and all the others. The distant
cries of the village soon died on his ears, and gave place
to the vast silence of the forest.</p>

<p>Then the good man, praising God for all things, let
his bridle fall on Bruno’s neck, and tranquilly ascended
the hill of Saverne.</p>

<p>The sun was high when he reached the road; but
though the heat struck full upon the nape of his neck,
though perspiration trickled down his spine, and Bruno
stopped from time to time to crop a few tufts of grass
by the wayside, the illustrious philosopher perceived
nothing of it. He already beheld himself in the theatre
of his triumphs, going from city to city, from village to
village, overthrowing sophists, and planting throughout
the world the beneficent germs of anthropo-zoology.</p>

<p>“Frantz Mathéus,” he cried, “you are truly predestined!
For you alone was reserved the glory of making
the human race happy, and of diffusing the eternal
light! See these broad-spread lands, these towns,
these farms, these hamlets, these cottages—they await
your coming! Everywhere the need is felt of a new
doctrine, founded on the three kingdoms of nature;
everywhere men are moving in doubt and uncertainty.
Frantz, I tell you this without vanity, but also without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
false modesty, the Being of beings has His eye fixed on
you! March! march! and your name, like that of
Pythagoras, of Moses, of Confucius, and of the most
sublime lawgivers, will be repeated from echo to echo
to the end of time!”</p>

<p>The illustrious Doctor was reasoning thus in all the
sincerity of his soul, and descending the side of the
Falberg under the shadow of the firs, when merry
shouts, peals of laughter, and the rasping sounds of a
violin, drew him from his profound meditations.</p>

<p>He was then about two leagues from Graufthal, in
front of the Dripping Pan public-house, where the
inhabitants of St.-Jean des Choux came to eat bacon
omelettes, and to dance with their sweethearts. A
number of people were there: mowers in their shirt-sleeves,
and peasant-girls of the neighbourhood in short
petticoats, whirling like the wind round the arbour.
They raised the leg, stamped, and made passes, double
passes, triple passes, and shouted enough to crack the
clouds.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, the fiddler, the famous Coucou Peter,
welcomed in all the beershops, breweries, and taverns
of Alsace—the good, the jovial Coucou Peter—was
seated on a barrel of beer in a recess of the garden, in
his big drugget jacket, garnished with steel buttons the
size of crown-pieces, with fresh-coloured, plump-looking
cheeks, and his hat surmounted by a cock’s feather.
He was scraping with full elbow-power an old country
waltz, and formed in himself the whole orchestra of the
Dripping Pan. Wine, beer, and kirschwasser flowed on
the tables, and vigorous kisses, quite openly given,
stimulated the universal enjoyment.</p>

<p>In spite of all his cares for the future of the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and of civilisation, Frantz Mathéus could not withhold
his admiration from this pleasant sight. He pulled up
behind the arbour, and laughed heartily at the little
kissings and lovemakings which he discovered through
the hornbeam hedge. But while the good man was
giving himself up to these curious observations, the
fiddler suddenly stopped in the midst of a flourish,
sprang from his barrel, and cried, in a ringing voice—</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!—the Doctor! Good Doctor Frantz!
Hi, there! Make way for me, that I may bring you
the inventor of the peregrination of souls and the
transformation of men into potatoes!”</p>

<p>It must be understood that the illustrious philosopher
had committed the imprudence of communicating his
psychologico-anthropo-zoological meditations to Coucou
Peter, who had no fear of compromising the system
by disrespectful allusions.</p>

<p>“Ho, Dr. Mathéus!” he cried, coming out of his
retreat, “you’ve come in the nick of time. Hey for
jollity!”</p>

<p>And throwing his hat into the air, he leaped the
ditch, climbed over the paling, and seized Bruno by
the bridle.</p>

<p>There was a general hurrah, for all the good people
present knew Mathéus.</p>

<p>“Come in, Doctor! Take a glass of wine, Doctor!—no,
a glass of kirschwasser—this way, Doctor!”</p>

<p>One took him by the collar, another by the arm, a
third by the tail of his coat; and they shouted, and the
women laughed, till poor Frantz did not know which
way to turn.</p>

<p>Bruno was led into the shade, and a feed of oats
given him, and two minutes afterwards the illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
philosopher found himself seated between Petrus Brentz
the gamekeeper, and Tobie Müller, the landlord of the
Dripping Pan. Before him danced Coucou Peter, now
on one leg, now on the other, and playing the famous
Hopser of Lutzelstein with a seductive energy that was
truly amazing.</p>

<p>“Take my jug,” cried Tobie.</p>

<p>“Doctor, you’ll drink out of my glass, won’t you?”
cried little Suzel. And her lips, parted with a soft
smile, showed her little snow-white teeth.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” stammered the good man, whose
eyes sparkled with happiness; “yes, with pleasure.”</p>

<p>Some one clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Have you breakfasted yet, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Hi, Maître Tobie! A bacon omelette for the
Doctor!”</p>

<p>At last, at the end of a few minutes everybody had
returned to their places: the young girls, their arms
resting on the table, and their hands entwined in those
of their sweethearts; the old papas in front of their
mugs of beer, the stout mothers against the hornbeam
hedge. Coucou Peter once more gave the signal for the
dance, and the waltzing recommenced with greater
spirit than ever.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher would have liked to have
begun to preach then and there, but he saw that youth
given up to pleasure was not in a condition to listen to
his words with all desirable attention.</p>

<p>In the interval between the galops Coucou Peter
returned to the table to empty his glass, and cried—</p>

<p>“Doctor Frantz, your legs must be stiff! Take one
of these pretty little pullets, and off with you both!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Look at little Grédel yonder—how neatly she’s made,
how appetising! What a waist! what eyes! what
pretty little feet! Grédel, come here! Doesn’t your
heart prompt you?”</p>

<p>The young peasant approached smiling, and looking
charming in her black cap and velvet bodice dotted all
over with glittering spangles.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Coucou Peter?” she asked archly.</p>

<p>“What do I want?” said the fiddler, taking her by
the chin, which was round, rosy, and smooth as a
peach: “what do I want? Ah! if I were only still
twenty! If we were only twenty, papa Mathéus!”</p>

<p>He placed his hand on his stomach, and sighed as if
his heart were bursting.</p>

<p>Grédel drooped her eyes, and murmured, in a timid
voice—</p>

<p>“You’re laughing at me, Coucou Peter—I know you
are—you’re laughing at me!”</p>

<p>“Laughing! laughing!—say rather crying, my pretty
Grédel. Ah! if I were still only twenty, as I said
before, then indeed I would laugh, Grédel!”</p>

<p>For a moment he remained silent, with a melancholy
air: then he turned towards Mathéus, who was blushing
up to his eyes, and cried—</p>

<p>“That reminds me, Doctor Frantz—where the deuce
are you off to so early in the morning? You must have
started at daybreak to be over here before noon.”</p>

<p>“I am going to preach my doctrine,” replied Mathéus,
in an ingenuous and natural tone.</p>

<p>“Your doctrine!” cried Coucou Peter, opening his
big eyes; “your doctrine!”</p>

<p>For a few seconds he remained wondering; but presently,
bursting into a roar of laughter, he cried—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! that’s a good joke—a good joke!
Ha! ha! ha! Doctor Frantz, I should never have
thought you were so funny!”</p>

<p>“What do you find to laugh at? Have not I told
you a hundred times at Graufthal that I should start
sooner or later? It all seems to me perfectly natural.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not going about like that?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I am.”</p>

<p>“You are going to announce your peregrination of
souls, your transformation of plants into animals, and
animals into men?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with many other not less remarkable things
which I have not had time to tell you of.”</p>

<p>“But, I say, you’ve put some money in your pocket,
at all events? That’s a very important article in
preaching.”</p>

<p>“I!” cried Mathéus, carried away by a noble pride;
“I have not brought with me a liard—not a kreutzer!
When one is possessed of the truth, one is always rich
enough.”</p>

<p>“One is always rich enough!” repeated the fiddler;
“that’s a good idea! a capital idea!”</p>

<p>The peasants gathered about them, and without understanding
this scene, saw plainly by Coucou Peter’s
face that something extraordinary was passing.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fiddler began to dance, waved his hat
gaily, and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“I’m in with it! It’ll just suit me!” Then, turning
to the crowd, astonished at his strange antics, he
cried—“Look well at me, you there! I’m the prophet
Coucou Peter! Ha! ha! ha! you don’t in the least
understand the meaning of it? Nor more do I! This
is my master; we’re going to preach through the universe!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
I shall march in front! crin-crin! crin-crin!
crin-crin! A crowd assembles—we announce the peregrination
of souls—the public feels flattered and—off
we go! We eat well, drink well—sleep here, gad there—and
off, and off, and off we go!”</p>

<p>He leaped, he laughed, he wriggled, in short, as if
the deuce were in him.</p>

<p>“Papa Mathéus,” he cried, “I’m with you—I’ll never
leave you any more!”</p>

<p>The illustrious Doctor could not believe that he was
in earnest, but he was no longer left in doubt when he
saw Coucou Peter mount upon his barrel and cry in a
loud voice—</p>

<p>“This is to let you know that, instead of flying away
to heaven as in the olden times, the souls of men and
women return into the bodies of animals, and those of
animals into plants, trees, and vegetables, according to
their conduct; and that, instead of coming into the
world by means of Adam and Eve, as many people say,
we have first been cabbages, radishes, fishes, or other
one or two legged animals—which is much simpler and
easier to be believed. It is the illustrious Dr. Frantz
Mathéus, my master, who has discovered these things,
and you will oblige us by so informing your friends and
acquaintances.”</p>

<p>With that, Coucou Peter came down from his barrel,
waved his hat, and gravely placed himself beside
Mathéus, crying, “Master, I abandon all to follow you!”</p>

<p>Mathéus, softened by the white wine he had drunk,
shed gentle tears.</p>

<p>“Coucou Peter,” he cried, “I proclaim you, in the
face of heaven, my first disciple! You shall be the
foundation-stone of the new edifice built upon the three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
kingdoms of nature. Your words have found an echo
in my heart; I see that you are worthy to consecrate
your life to this noble cause.”</p>

<p>And he kissed him on both cheeks.</p>

<p>The peasants were all astonished at this scene; however,
when they saw the fiddler putting his violin into
his bag, a vague murmur arose, and, but for their respect
for Frantz, they would have been very angry.
The illustrious philosopher rose and said to them—</p>

<p>“My children, we have passed many years together;
most of you I have seen grow up under my eyes; others
have been my friends. You know that I have done for
you all it was in my power to do; I have never spared
trouble to be of service to you, nor care, nor my small
fortune, the fruit of my father’s hard toil! Henceforth
the universe claims me; I owe myself to humanity; let
us part good friends, and think sometimes of Frantz
Mathéus, who has loved you so well!”</p>

<p>Tears choked his utterance as he pronounced these
last words, and he had to be assisted to his horse, so
greatly was the good man affected.</p>

<p>Everybody wept, and regretted this excellent physician—the
father of the poor, the consoler of the unfortunate.
They watched him slowly going away, his
head buried between his hands; nobody spoke a word
or uttered a cry, for fear of adding to his sorrow, and
all felt that they were suffering an irreparable loss.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, with his hat cocked upon his ear, and
his bag over his shoulder, followed the doctor, looking
as proud as a cock. Now and then he turned, and
seemed to say, “I laugh at all of you now! I’m
a prophet!—the prophet Coucou Peter—with an off,
and an off, and an off we go!”</p>

</div>

<p>To see Frantz Mathéus and his disciple descending
the narrow path of the Steinbach, through the tall firs,
no one would ever have thought that those two extraordinary
men were on their way to conquer the world.
It is true that the illustrious philosopher, gravely bestriding
Bruno, with head erect and pendent legs, had
something majestic in his appearance; but Coucou
Peter did not in the least look like a real prophet. His
jovial countenance, fat stomach, and his cock’s feather,
gave him rather the aspect of a jolly drinking companion,
who cultivated deplorable prejudices in favour
of good cheer, and thought not at all of the disastrous
consequences of his physical appetites.</p>

<p>This remark did not inspire Mathéus with any very
serious reflections, but he proposed to himself, by putting
his follower under a psychologico-anthropo-zoological
regime, by inducing moderation, and, in short,
by penetrating him with the leading principles of his
doctrine, to bring him into a more desirable physical
condition.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter looked at the matter from quite another
point of view.</p>

<p>“Won’t people be surprised to see me a prophet!”
he said to himself. “Ha! ha! ha! the droll dog is
always up to something! What the devil is he up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
now, preaching about this transformation of bodies
and peregrination of souls? What’s the meaning of
it? The <i>Strasbourg Almanack</i>, next year, will take
notice of it! They’ll draw me on the first page with
my violin, and underneath, in large letters, that every
one will be able to read, ‘Coucou Peter, son of Yokel
Peter, of Lutzelstein, who set out to convert the universe.’
Ha! ha! ha!—you’ll make a good thing out
of it, my jolly prophet! Eat enough for four, drink
enough for six, and preach temperance to everybody
else! And, who knows?—when you grow old you may
become chief rabbi of the peregrination of souls, sleep
in a feather-bed, let your beard grow, and clap spectacles
on your nose! You cunning rascal, I should
never have thought of your laying hold of so good a
place!”</p>

<p>In spite of himself, however, some few doubts still
presented themselves to his mind; these pleasant hopes
appeared to him hazardous; he foresaw impediments,
and conceived vague apprehensions.</p>

<p>“I say, Maître Frantz,” he said, quickening his pace,
“my tongue has been itching to speak for the last
quarter of an hour; I want very much to ask you something.”</p>

<p>“Speak out, my good fellow,” replied the Doctor;
“don’t stand on ceremony. Do you already feel your
noble resolutions shaken by doubt?”</p>

<p>“Exactly—and that bothers me. Are you quite sure
about your peregrination of souls, Maître Frantz? For,
to tell you the truth, I’ve no recollection of having
lived before coming into the world.”</p>

<p>“Am I quite sure!” cried Mathéus. “Do you
imagine that I would deceive the world, cast desolation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
into the midst of families, agitation into cities, disorder
into consciences?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say that, Doctor; on the contrary, I’m altogether
for the doctrine. But, mind you, there are
many others who won’t believe in it, and who will say,
‘What the devil does he mean by bothering us with
stuff about his souls that go back into the bodies of
animals?—does he take us for fools? Souls that travel
about!—souls that go up and down the ladder of
being!—souls on four feet, and souls that sprout with
leaves! Ha! ha! ha! the man is mad! he’s mad!’
I don’t say that, Maître Frantz; it’s other people, you
understand? <i>I</i> believe everything; but let’s see how
you will answer the others.”</p>

<p>“What shall I reply to them?” cried Mathéus, pale
with indignation.</p>

<p>“That’s it; what will you reply to these unbelievers—these
good-for-nothings?”</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher had stopped in the
middle of the path; he raised himself in his stirrups
and cried, in a ringing voice—</p>

<p>“Miserable sophists! disciples of error and false
doctrines! your captious quibbles, your scholastic
subtleties, will avail you nothing against me! In vain
would you attempt to obscure the planet which shines
in the skyey vault—that planet which gives you light
and warmth, and to nature its fecundity! In spite
of your blasphemies, in spite of your ingratitude, it
ceases not to shed its bounties! What need have I
to see the soul that inspires me with the noblest of
thoughts? Is it not ever present in my being—is
it not myself? Cut off these arms, these legs; will
Frantz Mathéus by that means be diminished, from an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
intellectual and moral point of view? No; the body
is but the outer case—the soul is eternal! Ah! Coucou
Peter, place your hand upon your heart, see before you
that immense vault, the image of grandeur and harmony,
and then dare to deny the Being of beings, the
First Cause of this magnificent creation!”</p>

<p>When Mathéus had improvised this discourse, Coucou
Peter looked at him with one eye cunningly closed, and
said—</p>

<p>“Very good—very good; you’ve only to talk to
peasants in that fashion, and all will be right.”</p>

<p>“You believe, then, in the peregrination of souls?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! We shall swamp all the preachers in
the country; there’s not one of them able to speak so
long as you without taking breath; others have to
blow their noses or to cough now and then to pick up
the thread of their discourse; but you—right on you
go! It’s magnificent! magnificent!”</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived at the crossing of the
Three Springs, and Doctor Mathéus stopped—</p>

<p>“Here are three paths,” he said. “Providence,
which ceaselessly watches over the fate of great men,
will point out to us the one we ought to follow, and will
inspire us with a resolution, the consequences of which,
for the progress of enlightenment and civilisation, are
incalculable.”</p>

<p>“You’re not wrong, illustrious Doctor Frantz,” said
Coucou Peter; “Providence has just whispered in my
ear that to-day is Saint Boniface’s day—the day when
Mother Windling, the widow of Windling, the public-house-keeper
of Oberbronn, every year kills a fat pig;
we shall arrive in the nick of time for black-pudding
and foaming beer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“But we shall not be able to commence our preaching!”
cried Mathéus, scandalised at the sensual
tendencies of his disciple.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, all will go well together. Mother
Windling’s public-house will be full of company, and
we’ll begin to preach at once.”</p>

<p>“You think there will be a considerable number of
people there?”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it; all the village will be there to
eat grills.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, let us go to Oberbronn.”</p>

<p>They went on, and towards five o’clock in the afternoon
the illustrious philosopher and his disciple turned
majestically into the only street of Oberbronn.</p>

<p>The animation of the village delighted Mathéus; for
above everything the good man loved country life. The
perfume of grass and flowers that filled the air at the
haymaking season; the big waggons standing loaded
up to the garret-windows of the houses, while the oxen,
resting from their work with legs outstretched to get at
bundles of hay hanging on the shining points of prongs
of pitchforks; the mowers reclining in the shade to
refresh themselves; the regular tic-tac of the threshers;
the clouds of dust escaping from the ventholes; the
shouts of laughter of young girls romping in the barn;
the honest faces of old men with white and bony heads
stooping at the windows, cotton caps upon their bald
pates; children escaping out of sight in the interior of
cottages, where hanks of flax hang about large cast-iron
stoves, and old women sing infants to sleep; dogs
wandering about and barking at the passers; the chirping
of the sparrows, disposing themselves on the roofs,
or audaciously swooping down upon the sheaves in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
shed—all this was life and happiness to Doctor Frantz.
For a moment he thought of going back to Graufthal.
Even Bruno raised his head, and pleasant cries greeted
Coucou Peter all along the road.</p>

<p>“Ha!—here’s Coucou Peter come to eat black-pudding!
Now we shall have some fun! Good day,
Coucou Peter!”</p>

<p>“Good day, Karl! Good day, Heinrich! Good day,
Christian—good day, good day!”</p>

<p>He shook hands right and left; but all eyes were
turned towards Mathéus, whose grave air, good cloth
clothes, and big horse, shining with fat, inspired the
deepest respect.</p>

<p>“It’s a curé! It’s a minister! It’s a tooth-drawer!”
they said amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Some of them questioned Coucou Peter in whispers,
but he had not time to answer their inquiries, and
hastened after the Doctor.</p>

<p>They at last reached the turn of the street, and
Frantz Mathéus immediately conceived the happiest
auguries on discovering the Widow Windling’s public-house.
A young peasant-girl was neatly whitewashing
the sides of a wooden balcony. Between two doors was
to be seen a superb porker hanging upon a wooden
frame, and laid open from the neck to the tail; it was
white, it was red, it was washed, shaved, and cleansed;
in fine, it was delightful to see. A big shepherd’s dog,
with long grey hair, was lapping up a few drops of
blood from the pavement. The windows were of
antique form. Poplars rustled in the air. The immense
boarded roof overspread the wood-store, press-house,
and yard, in which a troop of pretty fowls were
clucking and pecking. On the perch of a dovecot were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
a pair of magnificent blue pigeons, cooing and swelling
out their chests. Everything, indeed, gave to Mother
Windling’s house a truly hospitable physiognomy.</p>

<p>“Hallo! hallo! hallo! You, there! Hans! Karl!
Ludwig!—will you come out, you idlers?” cried the
fiddler as he approached. “What! aren’t you ashamed
of yourselves to leave the learned Doctor Mathéus at
the door?”</p>

<p>The house was full of customers, and it might have
been supposed that a visiting controller, a garde général,
or even an under-prefect, had arrived, so loudly did he
raise his voice, and such airs of importance did he give
himself.</p>

<p>Nickel the serving-man appeared at the outer gate in
a state of alarm, crying, “Good gracious! what’s all
this noise about?”</p>

<p>“What’s it about, you unfortunate! Don’t you see
the illustrious Doctor Mathéus, the inventor of the
peregrination of souls, waiting for you to hold his
stirrup? Make haste!—lead his horse to the stable;
but, I warn you, I shall have an eye on the manger,
and if there is but a single atom of straw amongst the
oats, you shall answer to me for it on your head!”</p>

<p>Mathéus then alighted, and the domestic hastened to
obey the orders given him.</p>

<p>The illustrious Doctor did not know that to enter the
principal room it was necessary to pass through the
kitchen; he was thus agreeably surprised by the spectacle
offered to his view. They were in the midst of
the preparations for the black-puddings; the fire
burned brightly on the hearth; the dishes on the
dresser-shelves shone like suns; little Michel stirred
the contents of the pot with marvellous regularity;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Dame Catherina Windling, her sleeves turned up to her
elbows, stood before the tub, majestically holding the
large ladle filled with milk, blood, onions, and chopped
marjoram. She poured slowly, while fat Soffayel, her
servant, held open the skin, so that the agreeable
mixture might conveniently fill it.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter remained like one petrified before this
delicious picture; he opened his eyes, dilated his nostrils,
and inhaled the perfume of the saucepans. At
last, in expressive tones, he cried—</p>

<p>“Good heavens! what a jollification we’re going to
have here! what a feast!”</p>

<p>Dame Catherina turned her head and joyously
exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Ah! Coucou Peter! I expected you! You never
forget to come in time for the puddings.”</p>

<p>“Forget! No, no, Dame Catherina, I’m incapable
of such ingratitude. They’ve done me too much good
for me ever to forget them.”</p>

<p>Then, advancing with a grave air, he took from her
hand the large ladle, plunged it into the tub, and for
some seconds examined the mixture with a truly psychological
attention.</p>

<p>Dame Catherina crossed her red arms, and appeared
to await his judgment; at the end of a minute he raised
his head, and said—</p>

<p>“With all due respect to you, Dame Catherina, a
little more milk is wanted here; the milk should never
be stinted—it gives the delicacy; it is, as one may say,
the soul of the pudding.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve been saying,” cried Mother
Windling; “didn’t I say to you, Soffayel, that a little
more milk would do no harm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Dame Catherina, you said that.”</p>

<p>“Well, now I’m altogether sure of it. Run and fetch
the milk-jug. How many ladlesful do you think,
Coucou Peter?”</p>

<p>The fiddler again examined the mixture, and replied—</p>

<p>“Three ladlesful, Dame Catherina; three full ladles!
Indeed, in your place, I should put in four.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put in four,” said the good woman. “It’ll
make sure.”</p>

<p>At that moment she perceived Mathéus, an unmoved
spectator of the gastronomic council.</p>

<p>“Ah! good heavens! I did not see this gentleman!
Is this gentleman with you, Coucou Peter?”</p>

<p>“It’s a friend of mine,” said the fiddler; “the
learned Doctor Mathéus, of Graufthal—an intimate
friend of mine! We are travelling for our own pleasure
and to spread the lights of civilisation.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Doctor, pray forgive me!” said Mother Windling;
“we are up to the eyes in puddings! Come in,
and pray excuse us.”</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher made several low bows, as
if to say, “Don’t think of apologising;” but he was
thinking all the time, “This woman belongs to the
order <i>Gallinæ</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a prolific race, naturally voluptuous
and fond of good living;” as her lively eyes, fat and
rosy cheeks, and her slightly upturned though large
nose, sufficiently proved.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This was what the Doctor thought, and certainly he
was not wrong; for Mother Windling had led a free-and-easy
life in her day; stories were told of her—stories—in
fact, extraordinary things; and, in spite
of her forty years, she had still very pleasant eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>Mathéus entered the principal room, and seating
himself at the end of the deal table, gave himself up to
judicious reflections, while Coucou Peter rinsed out the
glasses, and ordered Soffayel to fetch a bottle of wolxheim
to refresh the illustrious Doctor.</p>

<p>While the servant was gone to the cellar, Dame
Catherina went up to the fiddler, and, laying her hand
on his shoulder, said to him in a whisper—</p>

<p>“Coucou Peter, this gentleman is your friend?”</p>

<p>“My intimate friend, Dame Catherina.”</p>

<p>“A handsome man,” she said, looking him full in the
face.</p>

<p>“Aha!” said Coucou Peter, looking at her in the
same way and with a strange smile; “do you think so,
Dame Catherina?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think him quite a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” said Coucou Peter, “I should rather think
so; a man with land of his own, a savant, a first-rate
physician.”</p>

<p>“A physician, a man with an estate,” repeated Dame
Catherina. “You haven’t told me all, Peter, I can see
by your face. What has brought him here?”</p>

<p>“Ha! how sly you are, Dame Catherina!” cried
Coucou Peter with a wink; “you see things any distance
off! If I dare say all—but there are things——”</p>

<p>He went on wiping the glasses dry.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Dame Catherina, does the miller Tapihans
still come to see you?”</p>

<p>“Tapihans!” cried Mother Windling; “don’t speak
of him to me! I laugh at him; he wants to marry my
house, my garden, my five-and-twenty acres of meadow-land,
the shabby fellow!”</p>

<p>“Take my word for it, he’s not at all the sort of man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
you want,” replied the fiddler; “the sort of man to
suit you is——”</p>

<p>Fat Soffayel came up the cellar-stairs at the moment,
and Dame Catherina appeared beaming.</p>

<p>“That’s right—that’s right,” she said, taking the
bottle; “I’ll go and wait upon the gentleman myself.
Go, Soffayel, and put four good ladlesful of milk into
the tub. Look and see whether I am tidy, Coucou
Peter—is my hair out of order?”</p>

<p>“You are as fresh as a rose, Dame Catherina.”</p>

<p>“Do I really look so?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and you smell like a dish of strawberries.”</p>

<p>“Go along with your nonsense!” she cried.</p>

<p>Then Mother Windling carefully wiped her arms on
the towel that hung behind the door, took the bottle,
and tripped into the principal room like a young girl.</p>

<p>Frantz Mathéus was seated by an open window,
watching the labours of old Baumgarten’s bees, whose
hive was just in front of it; broad streaks of sunlight
pierced the flowering rose-trees, and the illustrious
philosopher, plunged in a soft reverie, listened to the
vague hum raised by the insects at the close of day.</p>

<p>At this moment Mother Windling entered; behind
her came Coucou Peter, gaily, with three glasses in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Make yourself comfortable, Dr. Mathéus,” he cried;
“you are tired, the day is hot; give me your overcoat,
and let me hang it up on this peg.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the good woman; “pray make yourself
quite at home. Coucou Peter has told me your
name, and Doctor Mathéus is well known in this part
of the country—it’s a great honour to receive you in
our house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>Mathéus, moved by a reception so flattering, raised
his eyes blushingly, and replied—</p>

<p>“You are very good, my dear madam; I regret not
having brought with me a copy of the <i>Anthropo-Zoology</i>,
to do homage to you with it, and to show my
gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we love men of intellect!” cried Mother Windling;
“<i>I</i> love men of mark!”</p>

<p>As she spoke she looked at him with so tender an air
that the good man felt quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>“It’s not a Tapihans, a man of no means, a miller,”
she continued, “that gives me so much pleasure to serve.
But only to hear the scandalous tongues of the village!
A report has been spread that we are going to be
married, because he comes here every evening to take
his glass. Heaven preserve me from wishing for such
a mere breath of a man! It’s quite enough to have
been left a widow once.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” said Mathéus, “I have no
doubt of it! Be sure that these reports have no influence
on me; it would be contrary to my philosophical
principles.”</p>

<p>The fiddler then filled the glasses, crying—</p>

<p>“Come, Dame Catherina, you must clink glasses
with the Doctor. Your health, Doctor Frantz!”</p>

<p>Mother Windling did not disdain the wolxheim; she
drank the health of Doctor Mathéus like a veritable
hussar. Then, without ceremony, she relieved him of
his greatcoat, and, with his wide-brimmed hat, hung
it upon one of the pegs on the wall.</p>

<p>“I must have you quite comfortable, and I see you
are not at your ease. I stand on no ceremony. Come,
Coucou Peter, another glass, and then I’ll go back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the kitchen to see about your supper. By-the-bye,
Doctor, you must tell me what you like best—something
roasted, a <i>fricassé</i> of chicken?”</p>

<p>“I assure you, madam,” replied Mathéus, “I have
no preference.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no; that won’t do. There must surely be
something you like.”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter gave her a wink as much as to assure
her that he knew the Doctor’s favourite dish.</p>

<p>“Very well,” cried the good woman, “we’ll contrive
something.”</p>

<p>After that she emptied her glass at a draught, smiled
at Doctor Mathéus, and went out of the room, promising
soon to return. Coucou Peter followed her for the
purpose of getting her to prepare a dish of küchlen, of
which he was very fond himself, and with which he
supposed the illustrious philosopher must also be
pleased. Frantz Mathéus, in delicious calm, remained
by the open window. He heard Mother Windling’s
voice giving orders, the bustle of the kitchen, the going
and coming; he attributed this attention to the reputation
which his magnificent work had already attained
in the world, and congratulated himself on the generous
resolution he had taken of enlightening the universe.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

</div>

<p>Night had closed in when Dame Catherina, bright,
affable, and smiling, reappeared in the principal room,
carrying a magnificent copper candlestick, shining like
gold.</p>

<p>The illustrious Dr. Mathéus, awaiting the arrival of
the peasants, had emptied the bottle of wolxheim, and
meditated a superb address, based on the judicious
principles of the wise and learned Aristotle; but the
entrance of Mother Windling suddenly changed the
direction of his impressive and luminous ideas.</p>

<p>She had put on her handsome large-flowered petticoat,
her little red silk fichu, and her Sunday cap, with
broad black ribbons spread out like the wings of a
butterfly.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher was dazzled; he silently
contemplated the plump arms, the well-rounded bust,
the bright eyes, and the truly provoking briskness of
the widow.</p>

<p>Dame Catherina speedily remarked this admiring
expression in the good man’s moistened eyes, and her
full rosy lips shaped themselves into a tender smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve kept you waiting a long time, Doctor,” she
said, spreading a white cloth over the table; “yes, a
very long time,” she repeated, with a mellow look that
penetrated to the depths of Mathéus’ bashful soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“Take care, Frantz, take care of what you are
about!” he said to himself: “remember your high
mission, and do not suffer yourself to be charmed by
this seductive creature.”</p>

<p>But he felt an indescribable kind of thrill run
down his spine, and dropped his eyelids in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>Dame Catherina was radiant.</p>

<p>“How timid he is!” she said to herself; “how he
blushes! Ah, if I could give him a little courage!
No matter; he is still green—and he’s very well made.
All will be right.”</p>

<p>At that moment Coucou Peter entered, carrying a
dishful of smoking puddings, laughing heartily, and
with the merriest face that ever was seen.</p>

<p>“Ah, Doctor Frantz!” he cried; “ah, Doctor Frantz,
what a scent! What a taste! All blood, bacon-fat,
and cream! Fancy, Papa Mathéus, I’ve already
gobbled up one half an ell long, and that’s only given
me an appetite!”</p>

<p>As he spoke he deposited his large dish upon the
table, with an air of adoration; then, spreading himself
against the wall, he untied his cravat, opened his
waistcoat, undid the three top buttons of his breeches,
to make himself quite at ease, and breathed a profound
sigh.</p>

<p>Fat Soffayel followed him with plates, covers, and a
big loaf of mixed wheat and rye, just out of the oven;
she ranged all in neat order, and Coucou Peter, taking
up a large horn-handled knife, cried—</p>

<p>“Now, Dame Windling, sit you down by the Doctor.
Ha! ha! ha! A happy meeting!”</p>

<p>Then, turning up his sleeves, he sliced up the pudding,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
and, raising a piece on his long fork, placed it on
Mathéus’s plate.</p>

<p>“Master Frantz,” he said, “introduce me that into
your organism, and then tell me what you think of it.”</p>

<p>At the same moment he noticed that the bottle was
empty, and uttered an exclamation of surprise—</p>

<p>“Soffayel! don’t you know that black-pudding likes
to swim?”</p>

<p>The servant, ashamed of her forgetfulness, hurried
away to the cellar; but in the kitchen she met Tapihans,
and said to him, in a bantering tone—</p>

<p>“Aha!—poor Tapihans, poor Tapihans! The cuckoo
sings in the house; you’d better go and look for
another nest!”</p>

<p>Directly afterwards, Tapihans, yellow and pale, with
pointed nose, long ears, and a cotton cap on the top of
his head, a hunch on his back, and his hands tucked in
the pockets of his grey waistcoat, appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Ah! is that you, Tapihans?” cried Coucou Peter;
“you’ve come just in time to see us eat.”</p>

<p>The little man advanced into the very middle of the
room, and for some seconds looked at the company,
but mostly at the illustrious Doctor and the widow,
who did not deign even to turn her head towards him.
His nose seemed to swell visibly; then, parting his lips,
he said—</p>

<p>“Good evening, Dame Catherina.”</p>

<p>“Good evening,” she replied, swallowing a piece of
pudding.</p>

<p>The miller did not stir from his place, and watched
the Doctor, who watched him, thinking: “This man
cannot belong to any but the fox species—a race given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
to plunder and possessed of little delicacy; moreover,
he is attacked by a never-dying worm; his pale complexion,
sharp cheek-bones, and keen eyes are bad
signs.”</p>

<p>After making these observations, he drank a glass of
wolxheim, which appeared to him delicious.</p>

<p>“So you’re not married yet, Tapihans?” cried
Coucou Peter, between two mouthfuls of pudding.</p>

<p>The little man returned no answer, but pressed his
lips closer together.</p>

<p>“A piece more pudding, Doctor,” said the widow,
with a tender look; “a little piece more.”</p>

<p>“You are very good, my dear madam,” replied the
illustrious philosopher, visibly affected by the delicate
attentions and kindness of this excellent creature.</p>

<p>Indeed, Dame Catherina filled his glass, turned upon
him her most flattering looks, and every now and then,
resting her hand upon his knee, leaned towards him
and whispered in his ear—</p>

<p>“Ah, Doctor Frantz, how happy I am to know you!”</p>

<p>To which the good man responded—</p>

<p>“And I also, my dear madam; believe me, I feel
deeply sensible of your cordial hospitality. You are
truly good, and if I can contribute to your improvement
it will be with the greatest pleasure.”</p>

<p>These little side conversations made Tapihans turn
pale; at last, he moved from where he stood, seated
himself in a corner of the room, near the fireplace, and
striking on the table, called out in a shrill voice—</p>

<p>“A mug of wine!”</p>

<p>“Soffayel, go and get this man a cup of wine,” said
the widow carelessly.</p>

<p>“This man!” repeated the miller; “is it of me you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
are speaking, Mother Windling? Perhaps you don’t
happen to know me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll call you Tapihans as much as you like,” replied
Dame Catherina sharply; “but don’t bother
me.”</p>

<p>Tapihans said nothing more; but he drank off three
mugs of wine one after the other, hammering on the
table, and calling—</p>

<p>“Another mug!—and look sharp in bringing it!”</p>

<p>“I say, old fellow,” cried Coucou Peter, raising his
voice, “you’re really not married yet, then?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I’m not, Coucou Peter, what then?” replied
the miller, with a bitter smile. “<i>We</i> can’t go
about the country like barefoot vagabonds who have
nothing to eat in their own houses; we have to take
care of our means, to look after what we’ve got, to cultivate
our lands and gather in our harvests. <i>We</i> want
to find wives amongst us; but women like better to
throw themselves at the head of the first scamp that
goes by—people that nobody knows from Adam or Eve,
or about whom too much is known; individuals who
fill their purses at the expense of the poor, and blow
into a clarionet to pay their shot. <i>You</i> know something
about that, friend Coucou Peter. We’ve a good deal to
put up with, but we have the consolation of being able
to say, ‘This is my meadow; this is my mill; this is
my vine.’”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, nonplussed for a moment, quickly
recovered his ordinary assurance, and replied—</p>

<p>“Meadows! mills! vines!—very good, Tapihans,
very good—but that’s not all; you still want a presentable
face; people marry faces; they like them to be
plump, rosy, fresh-looking—something in my style,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
he said, stroking his cheeks and rolling his eyes impudently.
“Women haven’t always mills before their
noses!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” cried Mother Windling, slapping
him on the shoulder; “how you always make me
laugh!”</p>

<p>By this time Mathéus, having finished his meal,
drank one more glass of wolxheim in short sips, wiped
his mouth, and turned slowly towards Tapihans.</p>

<p>“Friend,” he said to him, “attend closely to what I
tell you: it is not meadows, gardens, or houses that
have to be considered when one marries; but races—that
is to say, families of carnivorous, frugivorous,
herbivorous, graminivorous, insectivorous, omnivorous,
or other animals which it would take too long to mention
here—which must be taken into account in considering
the use of life. Observe: pigeons do not pair
with buzzards, foxes with cats, goats with birds; well!
it must be the same with men, for if you examine the
matter from the psychologico-anthropo-zoological point
of view, the only true method—because it is the only
one that is universal—you will observe that there are
species of men as well as species of animals. It is very
simple: we all come from one animal, as I have demonstrated
in the twenty-third chapter of the eighth volume
of my <i>Palingenesis</i>: read that work, and you will be
convinced of it. Now, then, we must mix and combine
races with judicious attention; it is the special mission
of humanity, which is the general meeting-place, the
fusion of all types, submitted to a new force, which I
call will. Let us still proceed by analogy: the race of
deer and that of hares, for example, might form a happy
mixture, while those of wolves and sheep could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
produce anything but a kind of monsters, at once stupid
and ferocious, cowardly and cruel! Alas! how many
of these sad alliances do we not see in the world!
Nothing but fortune is now consulted, and that is very
wrong! Now, as particularly regards you, my friend—I
do not advise you to marry. Your health——”</p>

<p>But Tapihans, pale with rage, would not allow him
to finish.</p>

<p>“What!” he roared; “do you dare to say that I
resemble a wolf?”</p>

<p>And, using all his force, he flung his jug at Mathéus.
Fortunately the illustrious philosopher, with his habitual
prudence, moved quickly, so that the missile struck
Coucou Peter full in the stomach, and caused him to
utter a dolorous groan.</p>

<p>Before Mathéus had recovered from his amazement,
Tapihans had opened the door and fled. Dame Catherina
rushed and seized a broomstick, and, standing on
her doorstep, was heard calling down the street—</p>

<p>“Blackguard! come back if you dare! Wretch!
to insult honourable people in my house! Was ever
seen the like!”</p>

<p>She then returned indoors, flew to Mathéus, begged
him to drink a glass of wine, sprinkled his temples with
cold water, and consoled him in all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter sighed, and exclaimed, in plaintive
tones—</p>

<p>“My organism is very ill, very ill! Soffayel, my dear
Soffayel, make haste and refill the bottle, or I shall
faint.”</p>

<p>At the end of a quarter of an hour Mathéus came to
himself, and murmured—</p>

<p>“This man evidently belongs to the race of beasts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
prey; he is capable of returning with a hatchet, or some
other instrument of the kind!”</p>

<p>“Only let him come back!” cried the stout widow,
doubling her fist in a threatening manner; “only let
him come back!”</p>

<p>But it was in vain she said that, for Frantz Mathéus’s
eyes turned ceaselessly towards the door, and the fear
natural to his timid species made him blind to all Dame
Catherina’s allurements.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, having no further excuse for getting
the bottle refilled, and feeling uncomfortable in the
stomach, proposed going to bed. Everybody agreed
with him, for it was late; the windows of the principal
room were all dark, and not the least sound was heard
out of doors.</p>

<p>Therefore Mother Windling took up the candlestick
from the table, told Soffayel to shut the shutters, and
begged Mathéus to be good enough to follow her.</p>

<p>They ascended the winding stairs at the back of the
kitchen, and everywhere Mathéus saw order and wise
economy; the passages were lined with great cupboards,
and in these cupboards, which Dame Catherina had
taken care to open, he saw tall piles of carefully-folded
linen, red-bordered tablecloths, napkins, hemp, and
flax. Farther on, grain spread to dry on wide floors;
here clover, colza, lucern grass; in another place,
wheat, barley, oats; it was a true store of abundance.</p>

<p>At last Mother Windling conducted him into a large,
well-furnished bedroom, in which there were two
chests of drawers, the tops of which were laden with
magnificent Lunéville chinaware, and Walerysthâl glass.
It contained also a canopied bedstead, as high as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Tower of Babel, and two handsome Saint Quirin looking-glasses.</p>

<p>Darting a last look at Mathéus, and pressing his hand
timidly—</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll sleep well, Doctor,” she said, casting
down her eyes, “and have no bad dreams.” She
smiled, and contemplated the good man for a few
seconds longer; then she closed the door, and left the
illustrious philosopher.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, according to his custom, had gone to
sleep in the barn.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

</div>

<p>That night Frantz Mathéus could not close an eye;
he ceaselessly tossed and turned with a noble enthusiasm
in his feather-bed, and muttered exclamations of
triumph. His heroic flight from Graufthal, the miraculous
conversion of Coucou Peter, his hospitable reception
by Mother Windling, kept running in his head;
he felt no desire to sleep; on the contrary, never had
his mind been more active, more lucid, more penetrating;
but the excessive warmth of his bed made
him perspire outrageously; so, towards morning, he
dressed himself and quietly descended into the yard to
breathe.</p>

<p>All was silent; the sun hardly lit the topmost leaves
of the poplars; deep stillness reigned in the air;
Mathéus, seated on the kerb of the cellar steps, contemplated
in speechless absorption the aspect of this
rustic dwelling and the repose of nature.</p>

<p>The large mossy roofs, the long beams crossed by
man’s industry, the tall gables, the dull skylights; in
the background, the garden-gate opening into the fields,
where the darkness was already beginning to fade; the
vague and undistinguishable forms of the trees—all
plunged the Doctor into the most agreeable meditations.</p>

<p>Slowly the daylight descended from the roofs, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
shadows grew larger in the yard below; then afar
off—very far—Mathéus heard a lark sing; then a cock put
his head out of the window of the fowl-house, made a step
forward, and expanded his shining wings to the fresh
morning air; a thrill of pleasure raised all his feathers;
he inflated his chest and sent forth a shrill, piercing,
prolonged cry, that reached to the surrounding woods.
The chilly hens advanced timidly to the edge of the
ladder, calling to one another, springing from step to
step, preening themselves with their beaks, cackling and
laughing in their manner; they spread themselves
along the walls, hastily snapping up the worms drinking
the morning dews. The pigeons very soon afterwards
were flying in wide circles round the yard. At
length the bright rays of the sun penetrated the stables;
a sheep bleated softly; all the others answered it, and
Mathéus opened a shutter to give the poor animals air.
A delightful sight then expanded the good man’s heart;
daylight streaming in amid the trembling shadows in
long streaks of gold lit up the dark beams, the harness
hanging against the wall, the cribs bristling with forage.
Nothing in the way of peacefulness could surpass this
picture: big oxen with half-closed eyelids, down-weighed
heads, and knees bent under their chests, were
still sleeping; but the handsome white heifer was
already wide awake; she placed her bluish muzzle,
glittering with moisture, on the back of the milch cow,
and looked at Mathéus out of her great surprised eyes,
as much as to say: “What does he want with us?—I’ve
never seen him before.”</p>

<p>There was also the draught-horse, looking very tired
and broken-spirited; but that did not prevent his
every now and then taking a wisp of clover, which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
ate because he had nothing else to do. The little black
kid raised itself on to the rack to get at a handful of
still fresh grass; but that which more than all struck
the doctor was the magnificent Glaan bull, the pride
and glory of Mother Windling.</p>

<p>He could not enough admire its broad crispy head,
like the stump of an old oak, its short and shining horns,
like iron wedges; its soft and supple dewlap, extending
from the lower lip to the knees.</p>

<p>“O noble and sublime animal,” he said to himself in
a tone of emotion, “you cannot imagine what profound
and admirable thoughts the sight of you inspires me
with! No, you have not yet attained the intellectual
and moral development that can raise you to the height
of a psychologico-anthropo-zoological sentiment; but
your forms are not the less marvellous; they attest, by
their harmonious completeness, the grandeur of nature;
for whatever may be said on the subject by materialists—beings
possessed neither of sound logic nor of reasoning
powers—that has not all been made in a day, but
has taken thousands of ages to bring to this degree of
æsthetic perfection. Yes, the passage from the mineral
to the vegetable form, from the vegetable to the animal
form, is immeasurable, without speaking of intermediaries;
for, from the thistle state to that of the oak,
and from the oyster state to that of the bull, the
distance is prodigious. Therefore, Frantz Mathéus,
admire within yourself that interior force, called God,
soul, life, or by any other name, and which ceaselessly
works towards the perfection of types and the development
of individuality in matter.”</p>

<p>He paused, plunged in mute ecstasy.</p>

<p>Now, while Mathéus was addressing these reflections<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
aloud to himself, the boards of the vent-hole through
which forage was thrown down to the cattle slid quietly
in its groove, and the chubby-faced head of Coucou
Peter was passed through the aperture. The fiddler’s
surprise may easily be imagined when he discovered
his illustrious master haranguing a bull.</p>

<p>“My eye!”—he said to himself, “I do believe he
wants to convert him!”</p>

<p>At the same time a singular idea flashed on his mind.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! it would be a good joke,” he cried;
“wait a bit, the bull’s going to answer you!”</p>

<p>He joined his hands before his mouth, and roared—</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh! great Doctor Mathéus—I am very—very
unhappy!”</p>

<p>At these words the illustrious philosopher fell back
in alarm.</p>

<p>“What is this?” he stammered, looking around him
with staring eyes. “What—what do I hear?”</p>

<p>But he could see nothing; Coucou Peter’s head was
hidden by a pile of straw in the rack, and this excellent
disciple laughed till his sides were almost split. After
awhile, he went on in bellowing tones—</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh! I am very unhappy! I was the great
Nebuchadnezzar. I thought of nothing but drinking
and eating, and so I lost my place on the Ladder of
Beings! Oh! oh! oh! I’m very unhappy.”</p>

<p>But the Doctor, though at first dumfounded, recognised
the fiddler’s voice.</p>

<p>“Coucou Peter,” he cried, “how dare you profane
the most sublime philosophy? Do you imagine me so
foolish as to give credence to vain illusions?”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter came out of the barn, laughing with
all his might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! what a joke! what a joke, Doctor
Frantz! When I saw you talking to the bull, it came
into my head to have a bit of fun.”</p>

<p>Mathéus himself could not help laughing, for he had,
at first, been taken in.</p>

<p>“I knew well,” he said, “that souls cannot retrograde
in the order of Nature; it is impossible—contrary to
the system; therefore my surprise was great, and it
was that which made me discover your trick. The
human soul cannot exist in the body of an animal; it
could not find sufficient room for the brain.”</p>

<p>The good man amused himself over his surprise a
long time, and Coucou Peter did likewise, holding his
sides.</p>

<p>They were still laughing, when Mother Windling, in
a short woollen petticoat, striped with red, her arms
bare to her elbows, still fresh-looking and full of grace,
opened the yard-door and descended the steps. She
had come to feed her poultry, her apron filled with peas,
millet-seed, and all sorts of grain.</p>

<p>“Ah! good morning, Doctor,” she cried, on seeing
Mathéus; “up so soon! Have you had a good night?”</p>

<p>“Very good, my dear madam—very good,” replied
Mathéus.</p>

<p>“Shall I go and light the kitchen fire, Dame
Catherina?” interrupted the fiddler.</p>

<p>“Yes, go, Coucou Peter; I shall be back presently.
You shall see some beautiful hens, Doctor. They’re a
real blessing. Chick! chick! chick! chick! Three of
them lay every day, and such eggs! Chick-chick!
chick-chick!—eggs as big as your fists. Chick-chick!
chick-chick-chick!”</p>

<p>The fowls darted forward, the ducks waddled, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
geese hurried with their wings spread, and all of them
cackled, cried, and quacked. They came from all sides;
top-knotted, feather-legged, large and small, blacks and
whites, yellows and reds; all struggling, springing,
flying delightfully.</p>

<p>“How charming to see!” murmured the illustrious
philosopher. “Oh, Nature, Nature, fecund mother!
rich-bosomed goddess! animation! breath divine! Thy
riches and variety are boundless!”</p>

<p>Mother Windling sidled, bridled, and smiled, attributing
to herself the best part of these eulogiums.</p>

<p>“Aren’t my hens plump and well kept?” she asked.
“I give them the best of everything. Look at that
great white one; she has laid every day these three
weeks. And the grey one down there, with the yellow
feathers about her eyes, she’s a real household treasure!
Only imagine! I’ve seen her lay twice in a day, an
egg in the morning and another in the evening, besides
those she hides. Look at that little black cock, a perfect
little demon! The day before yesterday he fought
and beat the big one, on account of the little red hen
there, a regular little shrew to set them by the ears!
I’ll bet they’re going to set-to again. What did I say!
You little villains, will you leave off? Did one ever
see the like!”</p>

<p>But all her calling out was of no avail; the two
rivals were engaged, beak to beak, with bristling neck-feathers,
springing one above the other, pecking viciously,
turning, leaping, and pursuing one another with
incredible fury; fortunately a fresh handful of grain
caused the two to suspend the battle.</p>

<p>“Strange!” murmured Mathéus, “that these gallinaceous
animals, usually so timid, are sometimes animated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
by the most ferocious instincts! What cannot
the furious and sanguinary passion of jealousy do!”</p>

<p>Mother Windling, looking at him out of the corner
of her eye, thought: “Poor dear man, you are thinking
of Tapihans! But you have nothing to fear. No,
no! the fellow is too much of a coward ever to come
to the house again.” At last, emptying her apron,
and looking at Mathéus with a tender smile, she
asked—</p>

<p>“Are you fond of eggs, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Very, my dear madam—most of all when boiled in
the shell; they are then a wholesome and delicate
food.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go at once and pick them up; there are
sure to be enough for your breakfast.”</p>

<p>Without the least ceremony or hesitation she climbed
up the ladder, and though the illustrious philosopher
had rapidly turned his head, he could not avoid seeing
the plump widow’s blue stockings, through which her
sturdy calves were very vigorously indicated.</p>

<p>Dame Catherina slipped into the fowl-loft through a
door under the pent roof, and reappeared radiant with
satisfaction, bringing with her a dozen eggs, which she
displayed triumphantly.</p>

<p>“See here!” she cried, standing at the top of the
ladder; “well, I’ve every day as many. What eggs!—not
a hen in the village lays such beauties! Help
me, Doctor—I daren’t come down alone.”</p>

<p>The good man was obliged to steady the foot of the
ladder and lend his hands to Dame Catherina, who
laughed, pretended to be afraid, and all the time
seemed quite at her ease. Mathéus was as red as a
raspberry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks, Doctor,” she said. “I’m sure the white
hen has laid behind the woodstack. I could see, from
up there, an egg lying on some bits of straw. We
must send Nickel to get it.”</p>

<p>She took the Doctor’s arm, and in this manner they
entered the house.</p>

<p>When Dame Catherina and Mathéus appeared in the
kitchen, Coucou Peter, seated on a stool before the
hearth, was blowing with all his might through a long
iron tube, to make the fire burn; the coals flamed, the
vine shoots crackled, water was bubbling in the boiler,
a magnificent cutlet was frizzling on the gridiron, and
spreading around a most agreeable odour.</p>

<p>Mother Windling paused on the threshold, and
cried—</p>

<p>“You rascally Coucou Peter! I’d like to know
where you got that cutlet from?”</p>

<p>Without in the least disturbing himself, Coucou
Peter indicated the large oak cupboard.</p>

<p>“He’s like a cat, he sees everything! But I thought
I’d put the key in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Who wants your key?” replied the fiddler, quite
gravely. “I don’t; with a bit of straw I can open all
the locks in the world.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the rogue!” cried the good woman, laughing,
“he’ll end with the galleys!”</p>

<p>Mathéus would have remonstrated with his disciple,
but Coucou Peter interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz,” he said, “I’m fond of cutlets—it’s
not contrary to the system to be fond of cutlets;
all that is not forbidden is permitted; isn’t it so, Dame
Catherina?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so; anyhow, you’ve always the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
word! Now get out of the way, and let me boil the
eggs. If the Doctor will go into the best room, I’ll
soon be with him; time to say a Pater, and all will be
ready. You, Coucou Peter, go and water the Doctor’s
horse: Nickel has gone this morning to turn the water
on to the large meadow.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, mother; with pleasure.”</p>

<p>The fiddler went out, and the illustrious philosopher
entered the best room.</p>

<p>Never had Frantz Mathéus felt more calm, more
happy, more content with himself and nature. The
open air had developed his appetite; he heard the
fire crackling on the hearth, the cat purring under the
table, and Dame Catherina sweeping the front of her
door, while humming Karl Ritter’s old refrain—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Love me, and I’ll love you! I’ll love you! I’ll love you!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Now he contemplated the ancient Nuremburg clock, all
yellow and worm-eaten, with its china face painted with
brilliant flowers, and its wooden cuckoo that chanted
the hours, and the illustrious philosopher never tired
of admiring its ingenious mechanism; now he stopped
before an open window, and gazed tenderly out upon
the little Place of Oberbronn.</p>

<p>There, about the green trough into which a stream
of clear water flowed from a moss-grown spout, were
gathered the young girls of the village, in short petticoats,
and bare armed and legged. They were beating
their linen, bawling, calling to one another, and noisily
chatting; and the good man smiled at their unsophisticated
manners and graceful attitudes.</p>

<p>Bruno was drinking at the trough, and every now
and then turned his head as if to salute Mathéus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Coucou Peter smacked his whip and said soft nothings
to the blooming laundresses, who made fun of his fine
speeches; but when—no doubt out of revenge—he
wanted to kiss the prettiest of the band, there arose an
incredible tumult of screams and laughter; the whole
of them fell upon him and thumped him with their
beetles and wet linen.</p>

<p>In spite of this violent attack, the impudent fellow
did not let the girl go: he kissed her on the
throat, on the nape of her neck, on her cheeks, crying
joyously—</p>

<p>“Oh, how good it is! beat away! beat away! I
laugh at it! I like it!”</p>

<p>Everybody came to the windows and laughed at
what was going on; the old women squalled, the dogs
barked, and Coucou Peter—red, moist, and out of
breath—repeated—</p>

<p>“One more little kiss, for love of the peregrination
of souls.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the rogue!” said Mathéus; “what an odd
disciple I have there!”</p>

<p>At length, seeing the peasants with their sticks running
towards the place, Coucou Peter mounted Bruno
in haste, leaped over the watertrough, and rode into
the stable, crying—</p>

<p>“How pretty the girls of Oberbronn are! They’re
as sweet in the mouth as cherries, and as crisp as
filberts!”</p>

<p>Then he tried to fasten the door, for the peasant lads
were furious.</p>

<p>Unluckily, Ludwig Spengler, the garde champêtre’s
son, whose sweetheart he had kissed, arrived almost as
soon as he, and pushed his stick between the wall and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the door, and the whole of them rushed into the stable.
Coucou Peter, yelling like the deuce, and calling out—“Friends!—my
dear friends—it was all a joke—nothing
but a joke!” was soundly thrashed.</p>

<p>They dragged him out, and blows with sticks were
showered on him like hail.</p>

<p>“Sweet as cherries!” shouted one.</p>

<p>“Crisp as filberts!” yelled another.</p>

<p>“I laugh at it!—I like it!” cried Ludwig Spengler,
striking with the full swing of his arm.</p>

<p>Mathéus, who was a witness of the whole affair,
called from the window—</p>

<p>“Courage, courage, Coucou Peter! accept this anthropo-zoological
trial with philosophical resignation;
even thank these young men for labouring towards
your moral perfection! For a long time I have remarked
that you belong to the family of bullfinches, a
voluptuous race, feeding on the buds of flowers, and
the most delicate fruits. After a few such lessons as
this, I hope to see you renounce these sensual principles.”</p>

<p>Poor Coucou Peter writhed, and looked pitifully at
his master, as much as to say: “I wish you had
been in my place, with your anthropo-zoological principles.”</p>

<p>The Doctor’s short address, however, produced a
happy diversion in Coucou Peter’s favour; the honest
countrymen, struck by the august physiognomy and
gestures of the illustrious philosopher, assembled under
the window, and the fiddler took advantage of this
moment to make his escape, and shut himself securely
into the stable.</p>

<p>Half the village were collected under the Doctor’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
eyes; they formed a circle, and looked at him over
each other’s heads and shoulders, all being anxious to
hear him.</p>

<p>Imagine the good man’s enthusiasm; he would
have liked to embrace them all; he could not contain
his delight.</p>

<p>“Frantz,” he said to himself, “the hour for your
preaching is come; it is clear that the Being of Beings,
the Great Demiourgos, has brought together this numerous
auditory for the purpose of their being converted
by you. You would be blind not to see in this
the finger of Providence!”</p>

<p>Such was his emotion, that for some seconds he was
unable to articulate a word; he blew his nose, he
opened his mouth; so great a number of arguments
presented themselves to his mind, that he knew not
where to commence: he wanted to say everything at
once.</p>

<p>But at length his soul became calm, and, in a ringing
voice, he cried—</p>

<p>“O, noble inhabitants of Oberbronn, privileged
beings of nature, humble and worthy country-people,
you know not how deeply I am touched as I look upon
you; you know not the glory that awaits you, the
treasures which I bring to you!”</p>

<p>At the word “treasures,” there was a great stir
amongst the crowd; they expected to see him plunge
his hand into a bag and throw money out of the window.
Those who were farthest off instantly struggled
to get nearer, and Katel the hunchback, who was in
the front rank, began to scream; the poor woman, seeing
others forcing their way before her, thought they
would deprive her of her share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>This appearance of interest gave evident pleasure to
the illustrious philosopher.</p>

<p>“Yes, my friends,” he continued, in a pathetic tone,
“I bring you treasures of wisdom, treasures of philosophy
and virtue!”</p>

<p>The crowd was undeceived.</p>

<p>“The devil fly away with you and your treasures of
wisdom!” cried Ludwig Spengler; “you look to me
to stand a good deal more in need of some than we
do!”</p>

<p>Mathéus, moved with indignation, stopped short,
with the view of overwhelming this rude fellow with a
grand apostrophe, but the little miller, Tapihans, approaching
the window, took off his cotton cap and
said—</p>

<p>“Good day, Abraham, what are you doing here?
Do you want to make Jews of us?”</p>

<p>“My name is not Abraham,” cried the illustrious
philosopher. “I am Frantz Mathéus, doctor of medicine
of the faculty of Strasbourg, corresponding member
of——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you well,” interrupted the miller mockingly;
“you call yourself Abraham Speizer, and not
more than a year ago you sold me a blind horse, which
I’ve never been able to get rid of. And, more than
that, if I’m not mistaken, you must be the rabbi of
Marmoutier!”</p>

<p>Hardly had he uttered these words than a great
commotion rose amidst the crowd.</p>

<p>“Set upon the rabbi!—down with the rabbi!—on to
the Jew!”</p>

<p>“My children, you are deceived!” cried the good
man, “your animal instincts blind you; listen to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>But nobody would hear a word he had to say. The
old women raised their broom-handles, the men their
cudgels; some looked about for stones; and Mathéus,
pale, overcome with emotion, stammered unintelligibly.
Suddenly acting upon a luminous inspiration, he turned
on his heels and fled into the kitchen.</p>

<p>The shouts and tumult then redoubled outside the
house. Dame Catherina herself was terrified.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” she cried, “what have you done,
Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, dear madame, nothing,” gasped the good
man; “it’s the miller, it’s——”</p>

<p>“Tapihans?—ah, the wretch! the wretch! He
wants to separate us; he’s raised the village against us!
But fly!” she cried, thrusting a large black-pudding
into his pocket. “Fly! we shall see each other again;
you will come some other time!”</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher did not need this advice;
he had already hurried across the yard, stammering—</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! we shall meet again in the spheres above!”</p>

<p>He darted into the stable by the back door, and found
his disciple buckling the girths of his horse.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter had observed the scene from a window
looking out on to the street, and foreseeing the issue of
the sermonising, had come to saddle Bruno.</p>

<p>“Aha, Maître Frantz!” he said; “you’re just in time;
I was off without you. Our peregrination of souls
doesn’t appear to take in this village.”</p>

<p>“Let us hasten away from this place,” cried Mathéus,
not knowing which way to turn.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that’s the best thing to be done; these
beggars of peasants are not up to our level. Get up
behind me, for there’s an end of our business here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>At the same time he mounted on horseback, and the
illustrious doctor clambered up behind him with marvellous
dexterity.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter at once drew the bar, threw open the
door, and dashed out like one riding for his life.</p>

<p>A terrible clamour rose on all sides of them, and
Mathéus immediately received three painful cudgel-blows,
Coucou-Peter calling out at each blow—</p>

<p>“Ah! ah! another psychological lesson!”</p>

<p>But the illustrious philosopher said nothing; he
closed his eyes and clung to his disciple so tightly that
the fiddler could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>Dame Catherina, standing on her doorstep, her eggs
in a basin, uttered plaintive cries as she watched these
proceedings, despairing of her dear doctor’s safety. But
when she saw his horse going off at full gallop through
the midst of the hooting and yelling crowd, the good
woman pressed her hand upon her tender heart, dried
her eyes with the border of her apron, and returned to
the kitchen heaving a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Poor, dear man!” she murmured; “may Heaven
conduct him!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>After galloping for a full half-hour, Frantz Mathéus,
hearing nothing but the beating of his horse’s hoofs on
the road, and the song of the birds in the free air, ventured
to open first one eye, then the other; and seeing
himself in the midst of a thick forest, far from the
cudgels and sophistical minds of the worthy country-folks,
breathed like one who has been cut down after
having been hanged.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, on his side, slackened Bruno’s pace,
and felt his own ribs to make sure they were still intact.
When he had thoroughly convinced himself that all
was in its place, he turned towards the village, which
was still to be seen through the trees, and extending
his hands with an imploring air, cried—</p>

<p>“Peasants of Oberbronn, the prophet Coucou Peter
curses you!”</p>

<p>“No, no—do not curse them,” murmured the good
doctor, in a tone of supplication; “do not curse them.
Alas! the unfortunates know not what they do.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for them,” replied the fiddler,
out of temper. “I curse them to the third and fourth
generation! Ah, you beggar, Tapihans! you beggar,
Spengler! I curse you both! I despise you like the
dust of my shoes!”</p>

<p>This said, he turned in the saddle and rode on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>Bruno was slowly following the path to Eschenbach.
The sun heated the sandy ground; thousands of
insects danced about the furze-bushes, and their vague
buzzing was the only sound that met the ear. This
immense calm of nature insensibly affected Mathéus;
he gently bowed his head, covered his face, and burst
into tears.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Maître Frantz?”
cried Coucou Peter.</p>

<p>“Nothing, my friend,” replied the good man, in a
stifled voice. “I am thinking of those unhappy people
who have persecuted us; I am thinking of the numberless
transformations they still have to endure before
reaching moral perfection; and I pity them for having
such bad hearts. I, who would have done so much for
them!—who sought to enlighten them on their future
destinies! I, who love them still with all the strength
of my soul! They strike me, cover me with abuse,
and misunderstand the purity of my intentions. You
cannot imagine how much this pains me. Let me
weep in silence; these are gentle tears, and prove to
me my own goodness. Oh, Mathéus! Mathéus! man of
virtue!” he cried, “weep—weep for the errors of your
species; but murmur not against eternal justice! That
alone makes your greatness and strength. In turn,
onion, tulip, snail, and hare—finally man. You have
not always been a philosopher; it has needed many
ages to overcome your animal instincts. Be indulgent,
therefore, and think that, if inferior beings do you
harm, it is because they are not worthy to comprehend
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very fine! We are knocked about, and
you take pity on those fellows!” cried Coucou Peter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
“The devil’s in it if we haven’t enough to be sorry
for on our own account!”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, my friend,” said Mathéus, drying his
eyes. “The more I think of it, the more convinced I
am that it could not be otherwise. A nameless prophet
was sent to Beth-el, on condition that he neither drank
nor ate; but having unfortunately eaten a piece of
bread, he was devoured by a lion, and his bones were
found between this lion and an ass that had been given
to him. Jonah was swallowed by a fish. It is true,
he only remained three days in the fish’s stomach; but
it is very disagreeable to be kept for seventy-two hours
in such a constrained position. Habakkuk was transported
by his hair through the air to Babylon. Imagine,
Coucou Peter, how much he must have suffered by
being suspended by his hair during such a journey.
Ezekiel was stoned. It is not exactly known whether
Jeremiah was stoned or sawed in two; but Isaiah was
certainly sawed in two. Amos was——”</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz,” cried Coucou Peter, abruptly, “if
you think to give me courage by telling me such stories
as these, you are very much mistaken. I won’t conceal
from you that, sooner than be cut in two, I’d rather go
back to my fiddle, and play tunes on it all the rest of
my life.”</p>

<p>“Come, come—do not be afraid. In these days
prophets are no longer so ill-treated; on the contrary,
handsome pensions are given to them—so long as they
maintain at least the existence of a soul.”</p>

<p>“And we, who maintain thousands of souls, deserve
pensions a thousand times bigger!” cried the gay
fiddler.</p>

<p>Conversing in this manner, the illustrious philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
and his disciple tranquilly went their way along the
valleys of the Zorn. Mathéus, who loved nothing so
well as the interior of the woods, forgot the ingratitude
of the human species; the scarce perceptible sound of
an insect nibbling the bark of an old tree, the flight of
a bird through the rustling foliage, the vague murmur
of a stream in the ravine, the whirl of the gnats dancing
above the still pools—these thousand details of solitude
ceaselessly furnished new texts for his anthropo-zoological
meditations.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter whistled to amuse himself, and from
time to time paid his respects to his flask of kirschwasser.
Bruno often went into the Zorn up to the
saddle-girths; at those times Maître Frantz and his
disciple clung to one another, raising their legs well out
of the way of the water, which they watched running
below them with tumultuous gurglings.</p>

<p>The heat, however, became overpowering; not a
breath of air penetrated the woods. Coucou Peter,
having dismounted, felt the perspiration streaming
down his back; Mathéus, who had not closed an eye
all night, yawned from time to time, murmuring,
“Great—Great Demiourgos!” without exactly knowing
what further he wished to say.</p>

<p>In this way they reached a gorge where the torrent
spread over a pebbly bed. Hardly had Bruno reached
the edge of the water, before the confounded beast
stretched out his neck to drink, and Maître Frantz,
not expecting this movement, was nearly shot over his
head. Coucou Peter quickly seized him by the tails of
his coat; and then the rogue gave vent to such a
formidable roar of laughter that all the neighbouring
echoes rang with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>“Coucou Peter! Coucou Peter!” cried the scandalised
Doctor; “are you not ashamed to laugh when I am in
danger of being drowned? Is this, then, your affection
for me?”</p>

<p>“I’m laughing, Maître Frantz, because you’ve escaped.
If I hadn’t got hold of you, you’d now be paddling in
the water like a frog.”</p>

<p>“This is an unpropitious day,” replied Mathéus; “if
we continue our journey, I foresee numberless misfortunes!”</p>

<p>“Many besides you have dropped off to sleep and
tumbled from their horses,” said Coucou Peter. “Lie
down on the moss, take a good nap, and the unpropitious
will have passed away by the time you wake. I’ll go
and have a bathe. Bruno won’t be sorry for a rest,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>This advice was too much in accord with the good
Doctor’s own ideas not to be agreeable to him.</p>

<p>“I approve of this pleasant design,” he said. “Lend
me the aid of your shoulder; I am stiff. Take off the
horse’s bridle. Go and bathe, my good fellow—go and
bathe; a bath will refresh your blood.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Frantz Mathéus laid himself
down at the foot of an oak, and was truly glad to be
able to stretch his limbs in the midst of the heather.
The crickets chirped about him. Now and then a
wave broke on the pebbles with a sharp slush; he
would then open his eyes, and saw Coucou Peter in the
act of undressing—of taking off his boots.</p>

<p>The sound of the torrent, the rustle of the leaves,
lulled his imagination into vague reverie. Through
the tufted branches of the trees he confusedly distinguished
the sky, the crests of the mountains. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
length his mind reposed; the same sounds fell upon
his ears, but their monotony resembled deep silence.
The good man distinguished them no longer—his soft
and regular breathing announced a profound sleep.
Then, perhaps, his mind, freed from its earthly trammels,
and going back ages upon ages, wandered, in the form
of a hare, through the immense forests of Gaul—perhaps,
also, he saw again the humble roof of his sires
at Graufthal, and good old Martha weeping for his
absence.</p>

</div>

<p>Now the illustrious philosopher had slept for three
hours when Coucou Peter cried—“Maître Frantz,
wake up!—Here are the pilgrims of Haslach coming
down the mountain; they outnumber the grains of sand
on the seashore; get up, master, and see them!”</p>

<p>Having raised himself, Mathéus perceived, first his
disciple perched in a wild cherry-tree, gathering the
fruit in the manner of the thrushes, and giving himself
up heartily to the pleasure; the eyes of the good man
were next directed to the neighbouring mountain.</p>

<p>Through the tall firs, farther than the sight could
reach, came an immense train of barefooted pilgrims,
their shoes carried at the end of their walking-sticks,
some carrying provisions, packages, flasks, and all sorts
of things necessary to life.</p>

<p>An old woman advanced alone at their head, reciting
a prayer in the midst of universal silence, the others
responding—</p>

<p>“Pray for us! pray for us!”</p>

<p>And this cry, repeated from mouth to mouth, to the
tops of the rocks, on the verge of the ravines, in the
hollows of the valleys, resembled the melancholy chant
of flights of cranes traversing the clouds.</p>

<p>The illustrious Doctor was so touched with the sight
as to be unable to utter a word, but Coucou Peter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
from the height of the tree, pointed out with his hand
each village as it reached the summit of the Nideck—</p>

<p>“Here come the Walsch folks!” he cried. “I recognise
them by their straw hats, their short waistcoats,
and their big breeches, that reach up to their armpits;
they are jolly fellows, making a pilgrimage to drink
Alsace wine. Those that are now coming after them
in short breeches and large coats with big buttons
shining in the sun, are from Dagsberg, the most
sanctified and poorest country in the mountains; they
are coming to the fair to kiss the bones of St. Florent.
Here come the St. Quirin people, in short blouses, and
caps cocked on their ears; look out for fisticuffs in the
procession! All these fellows from the glass houses
and factories love to get drunk and fight against the
Germans; it isn’t with them, Maître Frantz, that it
will do to discuss the peregrination of souls. Look at
those now coming down the branch road of Roche
Plate; they are called the Big Jims of the mountain;
they’ve joined the pilgrimage to show their fine clothes.
See how they’ve covered their hats with their handkerchiefs,
and tucked their trousers into the tops of
their boots; they are the swells of Aberschwiller, and
walk gravely with their noses in the air! But who the
deuce can those be, coming staggering after them?
Ah! I recognise ’em—they are the people of the plain,
the Lorrainers, with their little bags filled with walnuts
and bacon. Lord, how tired they look! Poor little
women, I pity them with all my heart. All these little
women of the plain are as fresh as roses, while those of
the highlands, of La Houpe for example, are as brown
as berries.”</p>

<p>The good apostle found something to say about every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
village, and Mathéus lost himself in the depths of profound
meditation.</p>

<p>At length, at the end of about an hour, the tail of
the procession came clearly in sight; it slowly ascended
the hill, soon passed round by the Nideck rock, some
few straggling groups following at intervals; these
were the sick, the infirm in waggons. They, in their
turn, disappeared, and everything returned to the
silence of solitude.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher then looked at his disciple
with a grave air, and said—</p>

<p>“Let us proceed to Haslach—it is there that the
Being of Beings calls us. Oh, Coucou Peter, does not
your heart tell you that the Great Demiourgos, before
bearing us to the scene of our triumphs, has seen fit to
offer to our sight a picture of the immense variety of
human races in this desert? Do you realise, my friend,
the sublime majesty of our mission?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Maître Frantz, I understand clearly enough
that we must be getting on our way; but first eat
some of these cherries I’ve gathered for you, and then
on we go!”</p>

<p>Although Mathéus did not find in these words all the
enthusiasm he could have desired, he seated himself,
his disciple’s hat between his knees, and ate the cherries
with a very good appetite. Coucou Peter having then
brought back Bruno, who was cropping the young
branches at some distance, Maître Frantz mounted, his
disciple took the bridle, and they passed up the sandy
path leading to the Roche-Plate.</p>

<p>The sun was setting behind the Losser, and long jets
of gold pierced the tops of the tall pines. Many
times Mathéus turned to contemplate this imposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
sight; but when they had penetrated the woods all
became obscure, and Bruno’s hoofs resounded under
the dome of the great oaks as in a temple.</p>

<p>About an hour afterwards, when the moon was beginning
to peep under the foliage, they perceived, fifty
paces below them, a group of pilgrims quietly making
their way towards the fair. Coucou Peter at the first
glance recognised Hans Aden, Mayor of Dabo, his
donkey Schimel, and his little wife Thérèse seated in
one of the panniers, but he was altogether surprised to
see a chubby child carefully wrapped up and tied in the
ass’s other pannier, for Hans Aden had no child that
he knew of. They were going along like veritable
patriarchs; little Thérèse, with her silk handkerchief
tied round her pretty face, looked on her child with inexpressible
tenderness; the donkey walked with sure
feet along the edge of the slope, cocking his long ears
at the least sound, and then, with a melancholy air, tall
Hans Aden, dressed in his long overcoat, the tails of
which beat against his calves, his three-cornered hat on
the back of his head, and his hands in his back pockets,
walked slowly, shouting from time to time—</p>

<p>“Hey! Schimel—hey!”</p>

<p>At this sight, and without waiting for Mathéus,
Coucou Peter scurried down the path, crying—</p>

<p>“How d’ye do, Maître Hans Aden?—how d’ye do?—where
the deuce are you going so late?”</p>

<p>Hans Aden turned round slowly, and his little wife
raised her eyes to see who it could be who was addressing
them in that fashion.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s you, is it, Coucou Peter,” said Hans, holding
out his hand to him; “good evening. We are
making the pilgrimage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“The pilgrimage!—what a lucky chance!” cried
Coucou Peter, joyously; “we are going there too.
Good faith!—an excellent opportunity to renew our
acquaintance. But what are you making the pilgrimage
for, Maître Hans Aden?—have you anybody sick in
your family?”</p>

<p>“No, Coucou Peter, no,” replied the Mayor of Dabo.
“Thank God, everybody at home is well. We are going
to thank St. Florent for having vouchsafed us a child.
You know that my wife and I have been married for
five years without having had that happiness: at last
my wife said to me, ‘Listen to me, Hans—we must
make a pilgrimage; all the wives who make a pilgrimage
have children!’ I thought there was no use
in it. ‘Bah!’ I said, ‘that’s no good, Thérèse—and,
besides, I can’t leave the house; it’s just harvest time;
I can’t give up everything.’ ‘Well, then, I’ll go alone,’
she said to me; ‘you are an unbeliever, Hans Aden,
and you’ll end badly!’ ‘Well, go by yourself, then,
Thérèse,’ I said to her, ‘and we shall see which of us is
right!’ Good!—she went; and imagine, Coucou Peter,
just nine months after came a baby!—a big, fat baby;
the finest and handsomest boy-baby of the mountain!
From that time all the women of Dabo have been wanting
to make pilgrimages.”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter had listened with singular attention to
this story; suddenly he raised his head and said—</p>

<p>“And how long is it since Dame Thérèse went on her
pilgrimage?”</p>

<p>“It was this day two years,” replied Hans Aden.</p>

<p>“Two years!” cried Coucou Peter, turning pale, and
supporting himself against a tree; “two years!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” asked Hans Aden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing, Maître Hans—nothing; it’s a weakness
that comes into my legs whenever I sit too long.”</p>

<p>At the same time he looked at little Thérèse, who
looked down and became as red as a cherry. She appeared
shy, and took up the child to give him the breast;
but before she had untied the fastenings, Coucou Peter
advanced, exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Ah, Maître Hans Aden!—how lucky you are!
Everything succeeds with you!—You are the richest
herr of the mountain; you have fields and meadows,
and here St. Florent sends you the handsomest child in
the world! I must have a good look at the little
fellow,” he said, taking off his hat to Dame Thérèse;
“I’m in love with all the little ones!”</p>

<p>“Stand on no ceremony, Coucou Peter,” cried the
mayor, proudly; “anybody may see him—there’s no
affront!”</p>

<p>“Kiss him, Monsieur Coucou Peter,” said Dame
Thérèse, in a low tone; “kiss him—isn’t he a beauty?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” cried Coucou Peter, while two big tears
streamed slowly down his red cheeks—“beautiful!—what
fists! what a chest! what a laughing face!”</p>

<p>He held the child up, and contemplated it with open
eyes; one might have thought he was never going to give
it back; the mother turned away her head to dry a tear.</p>

<p>At last the merry fiddler himself put back the little
one into the pannier, carefully raising the pillow before
laying him down upon it.</p>

<p>“Look you, Dame Thérèse,” he whispered, “children
like to have their heads high—don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>He then buckled the strap and laughed with the
pretty little mother, while tall Hans Aden stood a few
paces off, cutting a hazel switch into a whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>Mathéus, who had been retarded by the steepness of
the path, now rejoined his disciple.</p>

<p>“Good morning, good people!” cried the illustrious
Doctor, raising his broad-brimmed hat. “God’s blessing
be upon you!”</p>

<p>“Amen!” replied Hans Aden, returning with his
hazel switch.</p>

<p>Dame Thérèse inclined her head gently, and appeared
absorbed in the most delightful reveries.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour they went on without
speaking; Coucou Peter walking beside the donkey,
and looking at the child with pleasure, and Maître
Frantz, thinking of the events that were in preparation,
self-absorbed.</p>

<p>“Are you still going about the country as you used
to go, Monsieur Coucou Peter?” asked Thérèse at
length, timidly. “Do you not sometimes rest?”</p>

<p>“Always on the tramp, Dame Thérèse—always content!
I’m like the bird that has only a branch to
perch on at night, and flies away the next day to
wherever there’s harvesting going on.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong, Monsieur Coucou Peter,” she
said. “You ought to be laying up something against
the time when you will be old—so worthy, so honest
a man; think what it would be to fall into poverty!”</p>

<p>“What must be must be, Dame Thérèse. I find it
enough to get my living from day to day, having
nothing but my violin to live by. Besides, I’m not
what you take me for to look at me; I’m a prophet!
The illustrious Doctor Mathéus will tell you we’ve discovered
the peregrination of souls, and are going to
preach the truth to the universe.”</p>

<p>These words roused Maître Frantz from his reflections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“Coucou Peter is right,” he said; “the hour is near,
the destinies are about to be accomplished! Then
those who have trained the vine and sown the good
seed will be glorified! Great changes will be wrought
in the earth; the words of truth will pass from mouth
to mouth, and the name of Coucou Peter will resound
like that of the greatest prophets! The tenderness
which this dear disciple has exhibited at the sight
of infancy, the age of weakness, gentleness, and simple
purity, is a proof of his goodness of soul, and I do not
hesitate to predict for him the highest destiny!”</p>

<p>Dame Thérèse looked at Coucou Peter, who modestly
cast down his eyes, and it was evident that she was
happy to hear so much that was good concerning the
brave fiddler.</p>

<p>At that moment they passed out of the wood, and
the town of Haslach, with its broad-pointed roofs, its
winding streets, and its church of the time of Erwin,
met their view. A thousand confused voices rose in
the air. All the houses were lit up as for a festival.</p>

<p>They descended the mountain in silence.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h3>

</div>

<p>About nine o’clock in the evening the illustrious
philosopher and his new companions made their entry
into the ancient town of Haslach.</p>

<p>The streets were so crowded with people, waggons,
and cattle, as to be almost impassable.</p>

<p>The tall houses with their jagged gables overhung
the tumult, throwing the light of their little windows
upon the excited crowd. All these pilgrims from Alsace,
from Lorraine, and from the mountains, congregated
about the public-houses and inns like ants; others had
settled themselves along the walls, others under sheds
or in barns.</p>

<p>The sound of bagpipes, the dull lowing of oxen,
the clatter of horses’ hoofs, the patois of the Lorrainers
and Germans, made an incredible confusion. What a
subject for meditation for Mathéus!</p>

<p>It was then that Hans Aden and Dame Thérèse felt
glad of having met Coucou Peter; what would they
have done without him in the midst of such a turmoil?</p>

<p>The joyous fiddler pushed aside the crowd, crying,
“By your leave!” stopping at the most difficult points,
leading Schimel by the bridle, advising Mathéus not to
lose himself, animating Bruno, knocking at the inn
doors to ask for lodging. But, in spite of all said concerning
little Thérèse, the mayor, and the illustrious
philosopher, he was everywhere answered—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“Go farther on, my good people, and may Heaven
guide you!”</p>

<p>He never lost courage, and cried gaily—</p>

<p>“Forward!—Never mind, Dame Thérèse, never
mind; we shall find our snug corner all the same.—Aha,
Maître Frantz! what do you say to this? To-morrow
we’ll set to preaching.—Maître Hans Aden,
take care of that cart!—Come along, Schimel!—Hey!
Bruno!”</p>

<p>The others were almost stupefied.</p>

<p>Mathéus, seeing that the people of Haslach sold their
hay, straw, and everything else to the poor pilgrims
worn-out with fatigue, felt his soul oppressed with sorrow.</p>

<p>“Oh, hard and unbelieving hearts!” he cried to
himself, “know you not that this spirit of lucre and
traffic will cause you to descend the Ladder of Beings?”</p>

<p>Unfortunately nobody minded him, and several people
at windows even laughed at his simplicity.</p>

<p>“In Heaven’s name, Maître Frantz,” cried Coucou
Peter, “don’t make any anthropo-zoological speeches
to these people, without you want to run the risk of
having to spend the night under the stars, and worse
still!”</p>

<p>As to Dame Thérèse, she pressed the brave fiddler’s
arm, to his evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>In spite of his indignation, the illustrious philosopher
could not help admiring the singular industry
of the inhabitants of Haslach. Here a burly
butcher, standing between two candles, sold three
and even four different kinds of meats. These different
meats, all thoroughly fresh, were a pleasure to
look upon; while the pretty servant-girls, with their
little baskets on their arms, their open eyes, and slightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
turned-up noses, looked more fresh, more plump, more
rosy than the steaks hanging on the hooks in the
butcher’s shop. Here a blacksmith, with bare arms
and smutty face, was working with his assistants at the
back of his forge—the hammers clattering, the bellows
blowing, the sparks flying out on the foot of the passers;
and farther on, Conrad the tailor was making haste to
finish for the fair a new scarlet waistcoat for the
mayor’s assistant—his blackbird in its wicker-cage
whistling a tune, with which he drew his needle in
cadence. Magnificent cakes of all sizes met the sight in
the bakers’ windows; and the apothecary, for this day,
had placed in his window two big glass bottles, one
filled with red, the other with blue water, with lamps
behind them, producing a superb effect.</p>

<p>“How grand the world is!” Mathéus said to himself;
“each day civilisation makes fresh progress!
What would you say, my good Martha, if you saw such
a sight as this? You would not be able to believe your
eyes; you could never have foreseen the triumph of your
master on so vast a stage! But truth shines everywhere
with eternal brilliancy, and overcomes envy,
sophism, and vain prejudices!”</p>

<p>The little caravan, jostled and driven from street to
street, at last came in front of Jacob Fischer’s good old
public-house, and Coucou Peter uttered an exclamation
of joyous surprise.</p>

<p>The lamp was swung above the door, lighting the
whole of the front of the house, from the sign of the
Three Roses to the stork’s nest on the topmost point of
the gable.</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz,” cried Coucou Peter, “do you like
cheese-tarts?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“Why do you ask?” said the good man, surprised at
such a question.</p>

<p>“Because Mother Jacob made kougelhofs and cheese-tarts
three days ago. It’s the only thing she thinks of;
it’s what one might call her philosophical idea when
the fair-time approaches. Daddy Jacob thinks only of
bottling his wine and smoking his pipe behind the
store; and when his wife calls he lets her call, knowing
that nothing will stop her; for she is like a hen that’s
going to lay—the more she is driven about the more
noise she makes. But here we are. What a lot of
people!—Come, Dame Thérèse, you may alight.—Maître
Hans Aden, come and hold Schimel’s bridle, while I go
and beg Daddy Jacob to take us in.”</p>

<p>They were in front of the public-house, the crowd
whirling around them. They saw the drinkers go up
and down the steps unsteadily; glasses jingled, cans
clashed; voices called for beer, sourcrout, sausages;
the servant-girls, whom the guests chucked under the
chin as they passed, uttered laughing little cries;
Mother Jacob clattered the plates and dishes, and
Daddy Jacob turned the tap in the cellar.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter entered the public-house, promising
soon to return. Indeed, at the end of a few seconds,
he came back with Maître Jacob himself, a hale man
with jovial face and shirt-sleeves turned up to his
elbows.</p>

<p>“My poor fellow,” he said, “nothing would please
me better than to be of service to you. But every room
is taken; I’ve nothing left but the barn and the shed;
see if either of those will suit you.”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter looked at little Thérèse with an air of
distress, and then at the crowded street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“If it were only for myself, Maître Jacob, I’d accept
it at once; a poor devil of a fiddler is used to sleeping
on straw. But just look at this good little mother, at
this poor child, and at this good Doctor Mathéus, the
cream of philosophers!” cried he, in a heartrending
tone of voice. “Come, Daddy Jacob—put yourself in
the place of these people!”</p>

<p>“What can I do, Coucou Peter?” replied the
publican. “With all the goodwill in the world, I can’t
empty my rooms; I can’t offer you——”</p>

<p>“Ah, Monsieur Coucou Peter, don’t give yourself
so much trouble on our account,” then said Dame
Thérèse; “we are not so hard to please as you think.”</p>

<p>“You accept the shed, Dame Thérèse?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she cried, smiling; “many others
would be glad to find a shelter in the midst of this
tumult—wouldn’t they, Hans Aden?”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, delighted at hearing her say this,
cared nothing for what tall Hans Aden might answer;
as soon as Dame Thérèse had accepted the shed, he
hurried down the garden in search of dry wood.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Daddy Jacob!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Take care not to set fire to the barn,” said the
landlord.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, Daddy Jacob—don’t be afraid!”</p>

<p>The night was dark; in a very little time a bright
and pleasant fire lighted up the beams and tiles of the
outhouse.</p>

<p>Ah! it was not the handsome bedchamber at Oberbronn,
with its two chests of drawers and good feather-bed,
into which one sank up to the ears. The black
beams showed from floor to floor to the summit of the
roof; and on the side of the street, four oaken posts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
sheltered you from the wind. No St. Quirin looking-glasses
were to be seen there, but stable-doors along
the wall; and from the far end of the shed, pigs,
raising with their snouts the planks of their sty,
wished you “Good evening.”</p>

<p>Maître Mathéus reminded himself, with satisfaction,
that other prophets before him had inhabited like
places.</p>

<p>“Virtue,” he said, gravely, “lives under the thatched
roof. Let us rejoice, my friends, that we do not dwell
in palaces.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Coucou Peter; “but let us
arrange things so as not to go to bed in the mud.”</p>

<p>Every one then set to work: Hans Aden climbed the
barn-ladder, and threw down some bundles of straw
through the window; Mathéus unharnessed Schimel
and Bruno; Dame Thérèse produced provisions from a
haversack!</p>

<p>Coucou Peter saw to everything: he gave forage to
the beasts, spread litter for them, hung up the harness,
tasted the wine, and never lost sight of the donkey’s
pannier in which the child was sleeping.</p>

<p>Very soon all was ready, and they comfortably seated
themselves on trusses of straw for supper.</p>

<p>Similar scenes were passing in the Rue du Tonnelet
Rouge; every group of pilgrims had its fire, the glare
of which was reflected on the surrounding houses.</p>

<p>To the tumult insensibly succeeded a vast silence;
all these worthy people, overcome with fatigue, chatted
amongst each in low tones as in the bosom of their
family. It was so with Coucou Peter, Hans Aden,
Dame Thérèse, and Mathéus: it might have been
imagined that they had known one another for long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
years, when they were seated about the fire, and the
bottle passed from hand to hand; they felt quite at home.</p>

<p>“After you, Dame Thérèse,” said Coucou Peter.
“Jolly, this small wine of Alsace!—Where was it
grown, Maître Hans Aden?”</p>

<p>“At Eckersthal.”</p>

<p>“A famous place! Hand me a slice of ham.”</p>

<p>“Here it is, Monsieur Coucou Peter.”</p>

<p>“Your health, Maître Frantz!”</p>

<p>“Yours, my children! What a beautiful night!—how
mild the air is! Great Demiourgos foresaw that
his children would have no place of shelter for their
heads! O Great Being!” cried the good man, “Being
of Beings! accept the thanks that rise from a sincere
heart! It is not for ourselves alone that He is to be
thanked, my dear friends; but for this innumerable
crowd of creatures come from so far with the honourable
purpose of paying Him their homage!”</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz, you are not seated comfortably;
take this truss of straw.”</p>

<p>“This will do very well, Coucou Peter; I am quite
comfortable as I am.”</p>

<p>Schimel’s pannier was set up against the wall, and
Coucou Peter, every moment, lifted the covering to see
whether the little one was sleeping soundly. Bruno
and Schimel were quietly munching their allowance;
and when the flickering rays of the fire fell upon the
posts, the windows fringed with rugged tufts of straw,
waggons, and a thousand other objects in the shade—when
it lit the calm and meditative head of the illustrious
Doctor, the tender face of Thérèse, or the jovial
features of Coucou Peter, the whole scene resembled an
old picture out of the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>Towards eleven o’clock Mathéus asked permission to
be allowed to go to sleep; tall Hans Aden had already
stretched himself by the wall, and slept profoundly;
Dame Thérèse was not yet sleepy, nor was Coucou
Peter, and they continued their conversation in a low
tone.</p>

<p>Before sinking into repose, Maître Frantz heard the
voice of the crier repeating in the silence—“Eleven
o’clock—past eleven!” then footsteps passing down the
street, a dog barking and rattling his chain; he opened
his eyes, and saw the shadow of Schimel’s ears moving
on the wall like the wings of a night-moth.</p>

<p>The servants of the Three Roses bolted the doors and
laughed in the passage; these were his last impressions.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h3>

</div>

<p>Daylight was spreading its golden hues upon the
posts of the shed when Mathéus was awakened by
ringing shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! See—see, Dame Thérèse!” cried
Coucou Peter. “Look at the little rascal! Isn’t he
cunning? Isn’t he? He’s born to be hanged!—ha! ha!
ha!—he’s certainly born to be hanged!”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz, having turned his eyes in the direction
whence these joyous exclamations proceeded, saw
his disciple near a trellis adjoining the Three Roses.
This trellis, decked with trees, was covered with magnificent
peaches. Coucou Peter was holding out one of
these peaches to the child in its pannier on Schimel’s
back. The child extended his little hands to seize it,
and the jolly fiddler advanced and drew it back, laughing
till the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p>Dame Thérèse, from the other side, looked at the
infant with a tender smile; she appeared very happy,
and yet there was a vague melancholy in her look;
Hans Aden gravely looked on, as he smoked his pipe
with his elbow resting on the paling.</p>

<p>Nothing more charming than this morning picture
could be looked upon; there was so much of
unaffected gaiety, good-humour, and tenderness imprinted
on the features of Coucou Peter, that Maître<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Frantz said to himself—“What an honest face! how
like a child he amuses himself! How happy he is!
how lighthearted! He is the best lad I have ever
known! What a pity that his sensual instincts and
disorderly love of the flask often carry him beyond the
limits of propriety!”</p>

<p>While these thoughts were passing through his
mind, the good man rose and shook the straw from his
clothes; he then advanced, took off his hat, and saluted
the worthy people, wishing them “Good day.”</p>

<p>Dame Thérèse replied by a simple inclination of the
head, so absent-minded was she; but Coucou Peter
cried—</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz, look at this beautiful child! what
fun he is! Tell us what race he belongs to!”</p>

<p>“This child belongs to the bullfinch family,” replied
Mathéus, unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>“To the bullfinch family!” cried Coucou Peter, taken
completely by surprise. “Faith, not to flatter you, Maître
Frantz—I—I think he has very good anthropo-zoological
reasons for belonging to the family of the bullfinches.”</p>

<p>Hans Aden having finished his pipe, put it in his
pocket, and said to his wife—</p>

<p>“Come, Thérèse, come; it’s time to go into the fair
before it becomes too crowded.”</p>

<p>“Are you going with us, Maître Frantz?” inquired
Coucou Peter.</p>

<p>“Certainly; where is Bruno?”</p>

<p>“In the stable; you’ve no need to take him. Dame
Thérèse is going to buy all sorts of things; but for
that, we should leave Schimel also.”</p>

<p>These explanations were enough for Mathéus; and
they all set forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>The whole town was filled with people; the waggons
and cattle had been cleared away by order of the mayor.
Garlands were hung from the windows, leaves and
flowers were scattered in the streets, and in the market-place
rose a superb altar; but what more than anything
pleased the illustrious philosopher was the pleasant
scent of moss and fresh-gathered flowers, and the garlands
waving in the air at every movement of the
breeze.</p>

<p>He admired also the young peasant-girls with their
head-dresses and bodies dotted with glittering spangles;
the old women, who were decorating the altar with
vases and candlesticks, were still more magnificent, for
they wore the old costume of yellow or violet flowered
silk and gold-brocaded coif, the richest costume ever
seen.</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz,” said Coucou Peter, “they worked
better in the olden times. I recollect that my grandmother
had a dress that had belonged to <i>her</i> grandmother,
and that was still new; nowadays everything
becomes old in four or five years.”</p>

<p>“Except truth, my friend. Truth is always young:
what Pythagoras said two thousand years ago is as
true as if he had said it yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s like old violins,” replied Coucou Peter;
“the more you play upon them the better they sound,
until they get cracked; they can be mended, but by
going on putting in new pieces, nothing of the old
fiddle is left, and the music becomes poor.”</p>

<p>Chattering in this way, our good folks arrived at the
fair. The crowd was already great: a thousand confused
sounds, of whistles, fifes, and children’s trumpets,
rang in the ears; the wooden stalls exhibited in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
open air their hardwares, wooden swords, dolls, looking-glasses,
and Nuremberg clocks; the voices of sellers
calling their wares drowned one another.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter would have liked to have made a present
to Dame Thérèse; he fumbled ceaselessly in his
empty pockets, thinking by what means he could get
some money. For a moment he had an idea of going
back to the public-house and selling Bruno’s saddle
and bridle to the first Jew who happened to pass; but
Hans Aden having remained behind, another inspiration
came into his head.</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz,” he said, “take hold of Schimel’s
bridle; I’ll be back directly.”</p>

<p>He then hurried to Hans Aden, and said to him—</p>

<p>“Monsieur Mayor, I have forgotten my purse at the
public-house, for my illustrious master and I have our
money in Bruno’s saddle; lend me ten francs; I’ll
return them to you by-and-by.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” said Hans Aden, pulling a somewhat
wry face—“with pleasure;” and he gave him ten
francs.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, now as proud as a cock, took Dame
Thérèse under his arm, and led her to the handsomest
stall.</p>

<p>“Dame Thérèse,” he cried, “choose whatever you
like. Will you have this shawl, these ribbons, this
fichu?—will you have all the shop? Don’t hesitate.”</p>

<p>She did not want to accept anything but a simple
rose-coloured ribbon, but he forced her to take a superb
shawl.</p>

<p>“Oh, Monsieur Coucou Peter,” she said, “let me
have the ribbon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“Keep both the ribbon and the shawl, Dame
Thérèse! Keep them for love of me,” he cried in a
low tone; “if you only knew how much pleasure it
gives me!”</p>

<p>He bought also a sugar dog for the child, then some
gilt filberts, then a little drum—and indeed did not
leave off buying till his ten francs were spent to the
last centime. He then appeared in his glory; and
when Hans Aden rejoined them, he was well pleased
to see that Coucou Peter had shown such attention to
his wife.</p>

<p>As for the philosopher, the sight of this great assemblage
strangely exalted him; he wished to begin to
preach, and every moment exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Coucou Peter, I think it is time to preach. Look
at this crowd—what a magnificent occasion for announcing
the doctrine!”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it, Maître Frantz—don’t think of it
for a moment! Here’s the gendarme going by—he’d
have you in his grip at once; none but quacks have
the right of preaching in the fair.”</p>

<p>In this way they made the circuit of the market-place
three times. Dame Thérèse purchased all she
needed for her housekeeping: a scrubbing-brush, some
tin ladles, a slice, and other articles of a like kind;
Hans Aden bought a scythe that gave a clear ringing
sound, some wooden shoes, and a currycomb.</p>

<p>Towards ten o’clock Schimel’s panniers were full of
things; the crowd became more and more numerous,
and raised clouds of dust; in the distance was heard
the whirling waltz.</p>

<p>In making their way towards the Three Roses, they
passed by the Madame Hutte, and such sounds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
gaiety fell upon their ears that tall Hans Aden himself
stopped to look at the spectacle.</p>

<p>A flag floated above the booth; girls and youths
flocked to the door; the pretty dress of the Kokesbergers,
with their hair-plaits decked with ribbons;
that of the women of Bouren-Grédel, with their watered-silk
neckties hanging down the back of the neck, their
red petticoats, their well-fitting white stockings, and
high-heeled shoes; the mountaineers in their broad-brimmed
hats ornamented with an oak leaf; the Alsatians,
in three-cornered hats, square-tailed coats, scarlet
waistcoats, and short breeches, presented an admirable
picture. The crowd was drawn towards this point.</p>

<p>Dame Thérèse felt an inexpressible desire to dance;
her hand trembled on the arm of Coucou Peter, who
looked up at her tenderly, and whispered—</p>

<p>“Dame Thérèse, shall we have a waltz?”</p>

<p>“I should like it,” she murmured, “but the child—I
dare not leave it; and besides—what would Hans
Aden say?”</p>

<p>“Bah!—don’t be uneasy, Dame Thérèse; a waltz is
soon over. The child has nothing to fear—he’s so
sound asleep!”</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur Coucou Peter, I dare not! Hans
Aden would not like it.”</p>

<p>They were discussing the matter in this manner, and
Dame Thérèse would have given way perhaps, when
the church-bells began to ring, and it was no longer to
be thought of.</p>

<p>“Thérèse,” said Hans Aden, “there’s the third
stroke; let us get back to the public-house, or we shall
be late.”</p>

<p>“No need for that, Monsieur Mayor,” replied Coucou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Peter; “you can go from here. I’ll take Schimel
back, and we’ll wait dinner for you.—You’ll do us the
favour to accept dinner, Maître Hans Aden and Dame
Thérèse?”</p>

<p>Hans Aden thought Monsieur Coucou Peter a very
good fellow, and Dame Thérèse took from Schimel’s
pannier the shawl he had bought for her; she put it
on, and as she did so she cast a tender look at the
good fiddler, who felt the tears come into his eyes.
She then took up her child, from which she would not
part company, especially as the benediction of St.
Florent could do it nothing but good, and, all being
arranged, the party separated in front of the church.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter took the lower road, so as not to meet
the faithful in the Rue du Tonnelet Rouge.</p>

<p>Mathéus gravely followed him, allowing his eyes to
wander, and recapitulating his invincible proofs. The
pealing of the bells shook the air; the bright sun, casting
its rays upon the moving crowd, all astonished the
good man; and the hope of shortly preaching made
him see everything from an agreeable point of view.</p>

<p>They were passing along by gardens on the slope of
the hill; from time to time they heard the report of a
gun, and saw puffs of smoke rolling in the air; the
noise of the crowd died away insensibly, and fresh grass
replaced the dust of the streets.</p>

<p>Turning round by the fountain where the cattle of
the town were brought to drink, he saw sportsmen,
gamekeepers in green dresses, and a good number of
peasants contesting for the prize of a sheep.</p>

<p>The target was placed on the opposite side of the
hill in front of a large oak; shooters standing behind
garden rails tried their guns, put the locks on full-cock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
shook their heads; some betted, others threw themselves
into attitudes as though they were playing at
skittles; and each thought himself cleverer than the
one who missed his mark.</p>

<p>Frantz Mathéus, whom the sound of a gun always
made tremble, hurried by into Acacia Lane, the solitude
of which, after so many tumultuous scenes, had a strange
charm. All the inhabitants of Haslach were at church.</p>

<p>At the last sound of the church-bells the firing was
repeated; the prelude of the organ was heard from a
distance. Maître Frantz and his disciple turned into
the Rue du Tonnelet Rouge in front of the Three
Roses.</p>

</div>

<p>When Coucou Peter led Schimel to the stable,
Mathéus, fatigued with walking about in the fair,
entered the public-house. The illustrious philosopher
was far from expecting the magnificent picture that
met his view: from one end to the other of the principal
room stretched a table covered with a cloth of
white linen with a red border; more than forty covers
were laid, and each cover had its clean stiff finger-napkin,
folded in the shape of a boat or of a mitre;
they all looked almost new, and as if they had just been
taken from the linen-press. Besides these, each cover
had its bottle of sound Alsace wine; and at regular
intervals large water-bottles, transparent as crystal,
reflected the windows, the sky, and the surrounding
objects.</p>

<p>Add to this, that the floor, washed overnight, was
sprinkled with fine sand; that the air freely circulated
through the half-open windows; that the smell of roast
meat came in puffs from a small window opening into
the kitchen; that the clinking of plates and dishes, the
“tic-tac” of the roasting-jack, the crackling of the fire
on the hearth, all combined to announce a great feast at
thirty sous a head; and you may imagine with what
pleasure Maître Frantz seated himself by one of the
small tables, wiped the perspiration from his forehead,
and awaited the hour of dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>Not a soul disturbed the quiet of the dining-room, for
it was well known that the Three Roses would have a
great crowd of guests on that solemn day, and that
nobody would receive any attention who went there
merely for a mug or two of wine.</p>

<p>For some time the illustrious philosopher gave himself
up to the enjoyment of this delightful repose; he
then drew from his coat-pocket the Synopsis of his
<i>Anthropo-Zoology</i>, and began to search for a text worthy
of the occasion.</p>

<p>Now, Mother Jacob, who had heard the door open,
looked through the little window from the kitchen, and
seeing a grave-looking man reading a book, remained
for a moment contemplating him; she then made a
sign to her fat servant Orchel to come to her, and
pointing to the illustrious philosopher, seated with his
elbow on the window-ledge in a meditative posture,
asked her if he didn’t resemble the old curé Zacharias,
who had died five years before.</p>

<p>Orchel declared it was himself. Little Katel, who
was at the moment attending to the dripping-pan, flew
to see what was going on; she could hardly repress a
cry of surprise. There was a great flutter in the kitchen;
each by turn peered through the little window, and
murmured: “It’s him!”—“It’s not him!” At length
Mother Jacob, having looked at him very attentively,
told Katel to go and mind her dripping-pan, and,
smoothing her grey hair under her cap, went into the
dining-room.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher was so absorbed that he
did not hear the door open, and Mother Jacob was
obliged to ask him what he desired, to attract his
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“What I desire, my good woman,” said Mathéus,
gravely—“what I desire you cannot give me. He alone
who sees and governs us from the high heavens, He
whose immutable will is the law of the universe, can
alone accord to me, in this supreme moment, the
inspiration which I ask of Him. I tell you truly—truly,
great events are preparing. Let those who feel
themselves guilty, either through weakness or ignorance,
humiliate themselves!—let them see their faults, and
they shall be forgiven them! But let sophists, people
full of pride, profane and incapable of noble and
generous feelings, and, I say, even of any sort of justice—let
sophists and sensualists, who, plunging deeper
and deeper in materialism, go so far even as to deny
the immortal soul, the principle of human morality and
of human society—let them tremble: there is for ever
a deep gulf between us!”</p>

<p>Mother Jacob, who reproached herself for not having
joined the procession for the last three years, thought
that Maître Frantz was reading her heart.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” she cried in alarm, “I see my
faults; I know well I ought to have gone in the procession,
but our house can’t be left to itself. I’m
obliged to see to it myself, and particularly to look
after the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“The kitchen!” cried Mathéus. “Is it for the kitchen
you neglect the great question of the transformation of
bodies and the peregrination of souls? Oh! my good
woman, you are much to be pitied! Why do you
amass vain riches at the price of your immortal soul?
For your children?—you have none. For yourself,
then?—Alas! life endures but an instant, and you can
scarcely enjoy it. For your heirs?—Is there any need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
for developing in them a love of the worthless goods of
the earth, from which spring cupidity, avarice, and
covetousness, which too often draw us to wish for the
death of those nearest to us?”</p>

<p>“This man knows everything,” thought Mother
Jacob. “He knows that I have no children; he knows
that my rascal of a nephew, who has left the Carabineers,
only waits till I am dead to inherit all that I possess;
and he knows that for three years I have not attended
the procession. He’s a prophet!”</p>

<p>Thus was Mother Jacob reasoning when the procession
commenced. A great clamour rose amidst the
universal silence; then the sounds of the church-organ
and singing were heard. Then, suddenly, the singing
entered the market-place: the shrine of St. Florent,
borne by young girls dressed in white, the cross, the
banner floating in the air, the curés of the neighbourhood
in full-dress, the choristers in red caps appearing
in the distance, then the noisy procession. But, instead
of taking the Rue du Tonnelet Rouge, it made the tour
of Haslach, according to the ancient custom directed
by St. Florent himself; and the valley was filled with
that low murmurous sound which the illustrious philosopher
had admired on the mountain: “Pray for us!—pray
for us!” It was like a great burst of wind in
the woods mingled with the resounding peals of the
bells; it was something immense.</p>

<p>“Oh, grand and splendid sight, truly worthy of man!”
cried Mathéus. “Admirable meeting of people mingling
their various thoughts in one sole thought, their souls
in the universal soul! Oh, noble and affecting image
of the future!—What then will it be when the entire
truth shall have resounded through the world; when,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
rising on the wings of transcendental logic, and soaring
towards the heavens, humanity will see, face to face,
the Being of Beings, the Great Demiourgos! To what
a boundless height of enthusiasm will not men rise,
since they are even now carried so far by a mere presentiment
of the truth!”</p>

<p>Speaking thus, the illustrious philosopher grew more
and more animated. But Mother Jacob had for a long
time quitted the dining-room, and was going from door
to door among her neighbours, saying that a prophet
had arrived at her house, that this prophet knew everything,
that he had told her all about herself—that she
had no children, that her nephew, Yeri Hans, coveted
her property, and that the time was near!—that he
knew our most secret thoughts, and worked miracles!</p>

<p>Orchel and Katel had also deserted their posts and
followed at Mother Jacob’s heels, supporting, confirming,
and embellishing all she said.</p>

<p>They would have left everything to burn, if Coucou
Peter, by an inspiration from above, had not gone into
the kitchen and seen the forsaken boilers. In holy
horror he had basted the roast-meats, looked to saucepans,
skimmed the stew, stirred the sauces, re-wound
the roasting-jack, put bread into the soup, took the
<i>küchlen</i> out of the oven and arranged all the dishes in
proper order, calling, shouting, and exerting himself.
But nobody answered him. At last, at the end of half
an hour, not being able to do any more, he went down
into the yard to wash his hands and face, for he did not
wish to appear in such a state before little Thérèse.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Mother Jacob and her neighbours
arrived; and finding everything cooked to a turn
and arranged in perfect order, ready to be served up, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
good women raised their hands to heaven and cried—“A
miracle!”</p>

<p>Hearing the tumult in the kitchen, Coucou Peter
immediately returned; and what was his surprise when
Mother Jacob, leading him to the little window, pointed
out Mathéus to him, and related the miracle which the
good man had worked!</p>

<p>He was on the point of bursting into a boisterous fit
of laughter; but suddenly he pressed his sides and drew
in his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried, “is it possible? That’s what I saw,
then!”</p>

<p>The neighbours all pressed about him and inquired
what he had seen. Then Coucou Peter gravely related
that, having passed by the kitchen-door, he had seen a
white form—a sort of angel—turning a spit.</p>

<p>“I saw it as plainly as I see you,” he said to Mother
Jacob.</p>

<p>And the good women all looked at one another in
mute astonishment. Not one of them had courage to
answer a word; they stole out on tiptoe without making
the least noise, and news of the miracle quickly spread
throughout Haslach.</p>

<p>When the time arrived for serving up the dinner,
Mother Jacob hardly thought herself worthy to touch
the lid of one of the saucepans; every moment she
turned her head, fancying the angel was behind her, and
her two servants were equally flurried.</p>

<p>In this manner Coucou Peter, for the sake of insuring
the triumph of the doctrine, deceived the whole town of
Haslach, and precipitated the illustrious Doctor Frantz
Mathéus, his master, into a new series of extraordinary
and marvellous adventures.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>Precisely at noon the procession was finished. The
curés, the choristers, the beadles, the women, children,
townspeople, and pilgrims, mingled together, re-entered
Haslach—some to sit down to a good dinner moistened
with white wine, beer, and coffee; others to eat their
provisions on the corner of a fountain, or on the stone
bench outside a public-house.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher felt that the time to preach
was come.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, coming into the dining-room, said to
him—</p>

<p>“Master, sit down at the head of the table; I’ll
place myself on your right hand, to sustain the
doctrine.”</p>

<p>Frantz Mathéus seated himself at the place pointed
out to him by his disciple, at the head of the table, in
front of the windows.</p>

<p>The room was very quickly filled by a crowd of people,
come from all parts of Alsace and Lorraine—all worthy
peasants who lodged at the Three Roses, and thought
nothing of thirty sous for a good dinner. There were
also some mountaineers, amongst whom were Dame
Thérèse and Hans Aden; these seated themselves on
the right of Coucou Peter, who took in his left hand the
large horn-handled carving-knife and fork to cut up the
joints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>Soup having been served, the dinner began in silence.</p>

<p>Dame Thérèse, with her child upon her knees, appeared
very happy in being near Coucou Peter, who
attended to her with the greatest care, and gave her the
nicest pieces.</p>

<p>Now the news of Mathéus and his miracle having
spread through Haslach, people from all quarters
hastened to the Three Roses, and stared into the
dining-room through the windows, demanding to see the
prophet. Mother Jacob, from the doorstep, told them
all that had happened, and the servants, left alone, were
hardly able to serve the dinner. Katel hurried round
the table, arranging the dishes, removing the plates,
and replacing the emptied bottles; while Orchel brought
the dishes from the kitchen.</p>

<p>The dining-room became more and more animated;
the convives, ignorant of the sublime mission of the
illustrious philosopher, chatted together on indifferent
matters—of the fair, the harvest, the coming vintage.
They ate, laughed, drank, called to the servants, who
rushed up and down the winding stairs with dishes of
sauer-kraut, saveloys, smoking sausages, roast legs of
mutton, ducks swimming in their own gravy, and little
sucking-pigs covered with beautiful golden-yellow
crackling.</p>

<p>In the midst of this joyous animation, Maître Frantz
thought he heard these prophetic words:—“Honour!
glory! Honour to the great Mathéus! Eternal glory
to the inventor of the peregrination of souls! Glory!
glory! honour! glory! Honour to the great Mathéus!
Eternal glory to the inventor of the peregrination of
souls!” And in mute ecstasy he leaned back in his
chair, dropped his fork, and listened to these far-off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
voices; but, in truth, this was but the effect of the
Eckersthal wine and the noisy hum of the room.</p>

<p>It was about two o’clock, and the moment for the
dessert had arrived—that moment when everybody
speaks at once and nobody listens, when every one
thinks himself witty, and first one and then another
laughs, without knowing why.</p>

<p>At that moment the illustrious Doctor rose at the end
of the table, and gravely began to explain the transformation
of bodies and the peregrination of souls. He
spoke calmly and said—</p>

<p>“Justice is the law of the universe; being, from the
beginning of time, was subjected to the law of justice;
all things have been made by it, and nothing that has
been made has been made without it. It was life, and
life was will; and will animated matter, whence came
plants, whence came animals, whence came man!</p>

<p>“There was a man sent by Heaven, named Pythagoras:
he came into the world, and the world has not
understood him—his doctrines have not been understood!”</p>

<p>Thus spoke the illustrious philosopher, and all present
listened in astonishment at his wisdom. But
amongst the number there was an old Anabaptist
named Pelsly, a God-fearing man; and this venerable
person was outraged by the doctrine of the illustrious
philosopher. So, raising one of his fingers with an
inspired air, he cried—</p>

<p>“Now, the Spirit says expressly, that in the time to
come some will abandon the faith, following erring
minds and diabolical doctrines, taught by impostors filled
with hypocrisy, and with consciences darkened by crime!”</p>

<p>Having pronounced these words he relapsed into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
silence. Everybody felt that he referred to Frantz
Mathéus.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher turned pale, for he heard
a murmur rise about him. Coucou Peter became as red
as a burning coal.</p>

<p>But quickly recovering all his strength, Maître Frantz
responded—</p>

<p>“Oh! impostors and unbelievers, dare you really
deny that Justice should be the law of the world?
Were not all beings equal before some had advanced by
merit? If they had not existed before being born, why
all the differences among them? Why should one be
born as a plant, another as a man, or an animal? Why
should one be born rich, another poor, stupid or intelligent?
Where would be the justice of God, if all these
differences did not come from merit or demerit in
anterior existences?”</p>

<p>The Anabaptist, far from allowing himself to be vanquished
by this invincible argument, once again raised
his long skinny finger, and said—</p>

<p>“Flee from impertinent and puerile fables, and exercise
yourself in piety; for piety is of use to all, since to
it have been promised the means of present and future
life. What I say to you is a certain truth, and worthy
to be received with entire submission; for that which
enables us to bear ills and outrages is that we hope in
the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, but
principally of the faithful.”</p>

<p>At these words the persons assembled appeared
greatly disturbed, and Mathéus saw afresh threatening
looks turned towards him. The illustrious philosopher,
in this critical position, raised his eyes towards heaven,
and cried—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Being of Beings! O Great Demiourgos! Thou
whose powerful will and immutable justice govern all
souls, deign—deign to enlighten this mind, obscured by
the veil of error and of prejudice!”</p>

<p>But the Anabaptist Pelsly, furious at this, cried—</p>

<p>“Is it not you, Spirit of Darkness, who seeks to
obscure our intelligence? Is it not written: ‘If any one
teach a doctrine different to this, and embrace not the
doctrine according to piety, he is puffed up with pride,
and he knows nothing; he is possessed of an evil mind,
which carries him into questions and combats of words,
which give birth to envy, contestation, scandal, and
evil suspicions?’”</p>

<p>The illustrious Doctor knew no more what to answer,
when Coucou Peter plunged into the dispute; for he
had sold Bibles and almanacs, and knew as much about
the Scriptures as the Anabaptist.</p>

<p>“But,” cried he, striking the table with his fist, and
looking at the Anabaptist with glaring eyes—“but
‘there is nothing hidden which may not be discovered,
nothing secret which may not be found out; for that
which you have said in the darkness shall be published
in the light, and that which you have whispered in
chambers shall be proclaimed from the housetop!’ I
say to you, then, Pelsly, hypocrite that you are!—‘You
can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but
how is it that you do not discern this time? And why
even of yourself judge you not what is right?’”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter had hardly finished speaking these
words when a great tumult was heard within the house,
and everybody looked at one another, asking—</p>

<p>“What is the matter?—what is the meaning of all
this noise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>Now it was old Margredel, the paralytic wife of Nikel
Schouler the weaver, who, having been told of the
miracles performed by the illustrious philosopher, had
come to be cured. The poor woman, seated in her
large arm-chair, which she had not quitted for two
years, was carried on the shoulders of four pilgrims. A
crowd pressed about her, crying—</p>

<p>“Courage, Margredel! Courage!”</p>

<p>Margredel smiled sadly, for she believed in the prophet,
and already felt life stirring within her.</p>

<p>On arriving in front of the Three Roses, Mother
Jacob, who had seen her coming, opened the outer
folding-doors—then that of the great dining-room.</p>

<p>Poor Margredel, such as her malady had made her,
was then seen, pale, emaciated, raising her thin hands
supplicatingly, and crying—</p>

<p>“Save me, Mr. Prophet!—deign to cast a look upon
your humble servant!”</p>

<p>And the crowd pressed into the passage, against the
windows, and even into the room, repeating the same
words. The confusion was extreme.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Coucou Peter wished to make his escape;
for he had no confidence in the miracles of the doctrine,
and was afraid of being stoned if his master did not
cure the poor woman.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher, however, far from feeling
any doubt, had such confidence in his mission, he at
once said to himself that the Being of Beings had sent
this unfortunate creature for the purpose of enabling
him to give to the universe a shining proof of the truths
of Anthropo-Zoology. Penetrated with this confidence,
he rose and advanced towards Margredel, who watched
his approach with wide-open eyes. The crowd made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
way for him, and Maître Frantz having arrived in front
of the paralytic, looked at her with great tenderness,
and said to her, in the midst of the most profound
silence—</p>

<p>“Woman! have you confidence in the Being of Beings—in
His infinite goodness?”</p>

<p>Raising her eyes to heaven, Margredel replied, in a
feeble voice—</p>

<p>“God, who sees into all hearts, knows how truly I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” cried Mathéus, firmly, “faith has saved
you! Rise up—you are cured!”</p>

<p>At these words, which came from his soul, all present
trembled to the very marrow of their bones. Margredel
felt an extraordinary strength pass into all her limbs; she
made an effort—rose—and then fell upon her knees,
weeping, at the feet of Mathéus.</p>

<p>“I am saved!” she cried; “I am saved!”</p>

<p>It was an affecting sight to see this poor woman at
the good man’s feet, who, smiling kindly upon her,
lifted her up and kissed her on her shrunken cheeks,
saying—</p>

<p>“That’s well—that’s well; return to your dwelling.”</p>

<p>Which she did immediately, crying—</p>

<p>“My poor children!—my poor children! I shall no
longer be a burden on you!”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz then turned towards the company, and
said calmly—</p>

<p>“It was God’s will—who dares to deny the power of
God?”</p>

<p>These words struck all present with admiration, and
Coucou Peter himself was so overcome by what he had
seen and heard, that, in his bewilderment, he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
not move from his chair, and cried, in a tremulous
voice—</p>

<p>“Master! I am not worthy to untie the strings of
your shoes! Master! you are a great prophet, a true
prophet! Have pity on your poor disciple Coucou
Peter—a being sensual and full of defects—who has
doubted you!”</p>

<p>The Anabaptist alone was unconvinced; he tore his
skirts and left the room, crying—</p>

<p>“And in that day he raised up false prophets, who
performed great prodigies and things astonishing, even
to the seduction, if possible, of the elect themselves!”</p>

<p>But the crowd would not listen to him, and did not
cease to praise Maître Frantz for the wonders he had
accomplished.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h3>

</div>

<p>It was thus that the illustrious Doctor Mathéus,
knowing the power of will, exhibited the greatness of
the Being of Beings.</p>

<p>Margredel returned to her home, and the crowd proclaimed
the miracle throughout Haslach. Her neighbours,
and those who saw her afterwards seated at her
door, said—</p>

<p>“Isn’t that Margredel, the paralytic, seated on her
doorstep warming herself in the sun?”</p>

<p>Some answered—“Yes, it is her.” Others said—“No,
it’s some one else, like her.” But she cried—“It’s
myself! The prophet at the Three Roses has
cured me!”</p>

<p>People from all quarters hurried to the Three Roses;
they abandoned the churches to go and see and hear
the prophet.</p>

<p>Frantz Mathéus stood at one of the dining-room
windows, watching this spectacle, and enjoying indescribable
pleasure.</p>

<p>“O Great Demiourgos,” he cried to himself, “I thank
Thee! I thank Thee for having permitted me to live
until this day! Frantz Mathéus may now die; he has
seen the triumph of Anthropo-Zoology!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Anabaptist Pelsly had gone to the
Mayor of Haslach to denounce the illustrious philosopher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>Monsieur George Brenner, the mayor, was seated at
table, surrounded by his friends, celebrating the Fair
Sunday with gaiety and feasting, when the Anabaptist
entered.</p>

<p>The Anabaptist related, calmly and truthfully, the
prodigious circumstances that had taken place.</p>

<p>“These men,” he said, “having known God, have not
glorified Him as God, and have not rendered thanks to
Him; but they have bewildered themselves in their
vain reasonings, and their senseless hearts have become
filled with darkness. They have lost their wits by
attributing to themselves the name of sages; they have
transferred the honour which belongs truly to the incorruptible
God to the image of a corruptible man, and
to the figures of animals, fourfooted beasts, and reptiles;
wherefore God has given them up to the desires of their
hearts, to the vices of impurity; so that by plunging
into these they have dishonoured their own bodies, put
falsehood in the place of God’s truth, and rendered unto
the creature adoration and sovereign worship, instead
of rendering them unto the Creator, who is blessed in
all ages!”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Pelsly the Anabaptist; and the mayor,
striking the table before him, cried—</p>

<p>“What is it you tell me? Are such things possible?”</p>

<p>“Come and see for yourself,” replied the Anabaptist.</p>

<p>The mayor rose, and left his wife, children, and friends
in a very ill temper; for since the return of the procession
he had not been able to enjoy a single moment’s
repose, and several persons had already spoken to him
about the miracles—not that of Margredel, but that
which had been wrought in Mother Jacob’s kitchen.</p>

<p>On reaching the Rue du Tonnelet Rouge he found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
much difficulty in proceeding, so great was the crowd
of people shouting—</p>

<p>“Glory! Honour to the prophet!”</p>

<p>In the distance the illustrious Doctor was to be seen
at the window, surrounded by Coucou Peter, tall Hans
Aden, and all the guests of the Three Roses, eloquently
haranguing the crowd.</p>

<p>The mayor succeeded in forcing his way through
the mob, however, and Coucou Peter suddenly caught
sight of him ascending the steps of the public-house.</p>

<p>This was a terrible shock to the brave fiddler, for he
at once saw that the doctrine was about to incur a
great danger.</p>

<p>Maître Frantz was still speaking when the mayor
entered the dining-room, and then the Anabaptist,
pointing to the illustrious philosopher, accused him in
these terms:—</p>

<p>“As it is through you, Mr. Mayor, that we enjoy
profound peace, and because several highly salutary
orders have been given by your wise foresight, we
accuse this man of being the leader of a seditious
sect, of bringing division and trouble into this town,
of teaching false doctrines, and of performing miracles.”</p>

<p>Astonished at hearing this accusation pronounced in
a loud and solemn tone of voice, Frantz Mathéus turned,
and seeing the mayor girt with his official scarf, was
terrified.</p>

<p>“By whom have you been permitted to perform
miracles and preach in public?” demanded the mayor.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher was at first unable to
answer; but after a few seconds he recovered his
courage, and said, with deep indignation—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>“Since when has permission been required to teach
the truth? Oh, horrible profanation, worthy of the
most rigorous chastisement and of the execration of
ages! Had Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and many
others, need of permission to teach their doctrines?
Were they not followed by their disciples, surrounded
by the respect, admiration, and enthusiasm of entire
peoples?”</p>

<p>Bewildered by this tirade, the mayor looked at the
good man for a few moments, and then said—</p>

<p>“It’s fortunate for you that we have no communal
prison, otherwise I would have had you taken to it at
once, to teach you to speak with respect to a magistrate
wearing his scarf. I give you twenty minutes to take
yourself out of this town, and if you stay here one
second longer, I’ll have you marched to Saverne between
two gendarmes.”</p>

<p>The guests all looked at one another in amazement,
and Coucou Peter, turning to the Anabaptist, who
triumphed in his turn, said to him, in a tone of disdainful
eloquence—</p>

<p>“It is said, ‘They will deliver you to the magistrates
to be tormented, and you will be banished on account
of justice.’”</p>

<p>And those present, not less indignant than the disciple
of Mathéus, would have fallen upon the Anabaptist
but for the presence of the mayor.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher had had time to recover
himself, however; and as his heart swelled with pain
in thinking that he was about to lose the fruit of so
many efforts and sacrifices, he resolved to defend himself.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mayor,” he said, with forced calmness—“Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Mayor, I shall with more confidence attempt to justify
myself, knowing that for several years you have governed
this province. You can without difficulty ascertain
that I have not been more than one day in
Haslach, and that this Anabaptist has not found me
disputing with anybody, nor getting the people together,
either in the churches, the temples, or in the
public places. He is not able to prove one of the
charges he has brought against me. It is true, and I
admit it before you, that I serve the God of Pythagoras,
hoping in Him as the Anabaptist himself hopes, and
knowing Him as he knows Him. For this it is that I
labour incessantly, to preserve my conscience exempt
from reproaches; and as it commands me to spread
the light by all possible means, I have set forth with
this honourable purpose, quitting the roof of my
fathers, my friends, and all that is dearest to me in the
world, to fulfil my duties. Allow me, then, to remain
in this place only one day longer—I ask no more—to
convert the whole town to the truths of Anthropo-Zoology.”</p>

<p>“The more reason why you should be sent away at
once,” interrupted the mayor; “instead of twenty
minutes, I’ll not allow you more than ten.” Turning
to the Anabaptist, “Pelsly,” he said, “go and fetch
the gendarmes.”</p>

<p>At these words Frantz Mathéus felt his hare nature
gain the upper hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!” he cried, his eyes
filling with tears, “posterity will severely judge you!”</p>

<p>He went from the room in silence.</p>

<p>For some few moments all present were saddened by
this scene. Coucou Peter’s eyes wandered dolefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
over the table, and he did not know what course to
take. Suddenly he drew himself up, and in a loud
tone cried—</p>

<p>“Posterity will severely judge you, Mr. Mayor! So
much the worse for you.”</p>

<p>This said, he cocked his hat upon his ear, crossed his
hands behind his back, and walked majestically out by
the same door as Maître Frantz.</p>

<p>After the departure of Coucou Peter there was a
great uproar. Jacob Fischer, a sensual man and
naturally covetous of money, recollected that Coucou
Peter and Mathéus had lodged in the outhouse, that
they had given Bruno two feeds of oats, and that they
had not only themselves dined at thirty sous apiece,
but that Hans Aden and Thérèse had dined also at
their expense.</p>

<p>He hurried after Coucou Peter, therefore, crying—</p>

<p>“Stop! stop! You are not going off in that manner,
without paying.”</p>

<p>Everybody followed the landlord, impressed by a
singular curiosity to see what further was going to
happen.</p>

<p>On reaching the steps into the yard, they saw Maître
Frantz coming from the outhouse, leading Bruno by
the bridle, and behind him Coucou Peter, with the
saddle, valise, and other things, hastening to get all
ready for departure, for he apprehended that an
attempt might be made to detain them.</p>

<p>Jacob Fischer uttered an exclamation of indignation,
and sprang down the steps four at a time.</p>

<p>“You are not going off so!” he cried. “I shall
detain this horse as security.”</p>

<p>And, filled with anger, he tried to stop Bruno; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Coucou Peter, pushing him back roughly, seized a stick
from behind the stable door, and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Stand back! There is nothing in common between
you and me!”</p>

<p>Jacob Fischer hung on to the bridle, and Mathéus
said gently—</p>

<p>“Put back your stick behind the door, my dear
disciple—put this stick back into its place.”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter looked as if he were disinclined to
obey; but when he saw the crowd stream down the
steps into the yard, he remembered the psychological
lessons of Oberbronn and gave in.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment a number of people
surrounded the horse, the illustrious philosopher, and
his disciple. Each one related the occurrence in his
own manner, and Mathéus was deeply distressed at
hearing all these cries, speeches, and explanations; for
if some approved, others highly blamed him for wishing
to go away without paying.</p>

<p>Among the crowd were Jacob Fischer and his wife,
big Orchel and little Katel, Hans Aden and Dame
Thérèse, Kasper-Siébel, the son of Ludwig-Siébel the
blacksmith, Passauf the garde champêtre, in his large
gendarme’s hat, the Anabaptist Pelsly, and the mayor
in tri-coloured scarf. There was a great tumult.</p>

<p>At length the mayor succeeded in obtaining silence,
and Jacob Fischer then stated the case.</p>

<p>“These people,” he said, “owe me for lodging in the
outhouse, for four dinners at thirty sous, and two feeds
of oats; that makes seventeen francs. If they go off,
where are they? I know nothing of them. Coucou
Peter never has a sou. I demand that the horse shall
be left in pledge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Mathéus replied—</p>

<p>“In all times prophets have been furnished with
victuals and drink in the houses of their hosts, who
considered themselves fortunate in being able to entertain
them; and when their doors have been closed
against them, they have shaken the dust from their feet
and betaken themselves elsewhere. And I say that
such obdurate-hearted men are greatly to be pitied: it
would have been better for them never to have come
into the world, since they do nothing but pain us by
the sight of their iniquities.”</p>

<p>In spite of this eloquent address, neither the mayor
nor Jacob Fischer appeared to be convinced; on the
contrary, the publican repeated the items of his bill:
so much for the horse, so much for the illustrious
philosopher and his disciple, so much for their guests;
in all, seventeen francs.</p>

<p>The mayor, seeing that the clamour was increasing,
said—</p>

<p>“Jacob, take the horse and retain it as security.
They’ll have to go on foot, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The landlord instantly snatched the bridle from
Mathéus’s hands, and the good man, who was quite
unprepared for the shock, nearly fell to the ground;
but he clung to Bruno’s neck, and enfolding it in his
arms sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>“Bruno!—my poor Bruno!” he cried. “They wish
to separate you from me—you, the companion of my
toils—you, my best, my only friend! Oh, do not be so
cruel! Bruno! my poor Bruno! what will become of
you, far from your master? They will ill-treat you—they
will care nothing for your long services!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>The tears of the white-headed old man moved all the
beholders.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> cruel,” they said among themselves, “to take
this poor old man’s horse from him. He’s not dishonest—see
how he weeps; it’s only good-hearted
people who love animals in that way!”</p>

<p>Several women, who had come like the others, with
their children in their arms, hurried away, for they
could not bear to see it.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, behind Bruno, hung his head
dejectedly; he accused himself of being the cause of
all, and two big tears ran down his red cheeks. Dame
Thérèse wept also; and as everybody was at a stand-still
to prevent the landlord taking away the horse, this
good little woman slipped behind Coucou Peter and put
thirty francs into his hand unseen.</p>

<p>“Accept this, Monsieur Coucou Peter, for love of
me,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter put the money into his waistcoat-pocket
and sobbed more than ever; then, after a few
moments, raising his head, he cried—</p>

<p>“Maître Jacob, I should not have thought this of
you!—I should have thought you would have trusted
an honest man! But since it’s as it is, here is your
money—and let go this horse at once, or I’ll split your
head open!”</p>

<p>He seized the stick again from behind the stable-door,
and everybody would have been glad if he had
belaboured that wretched publican.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter even repaid Hans Aden, casting upon
Thérèse so tender a look that she felt embarrassed to
the bottom of her soul; he also kissed the child which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
she held in her arms. Then, in a loud ringing voice,
he cried—</p>

<p>“Forward, Maître Frantz! forward! Men are
rascals!”</p>

<p>Mathéus mounted on horseback, Coucou Peter threw
open the gate into the field, and the mayor felt at ease
only after seeing them disappear in the forest of
Saverne.</p>

<p>A great uproar then arose in the town; the
prophet was called for, and the crowd demanded
miracles!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h3>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to describe the dejection of Frantz
Mathéus and his disciple after they had left Haslach.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter could no longer control his anger; at
every step he flourished his stick and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Rascally Anabaptist! rascally mayor! rascally Jacob
Fischer! Ah, you scamps! if I only had you here, I’d
make you dance! I would not leave a hair on your
heads! To drive out so worthy a man!—a man who
performs miracles!—a man worth more than all of you
to the twentieth generation! Scamps! vagabonds!
it’ll be a lucky day for you if I meet you sooner or
later!”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Coucou Peter, turning a backward glance
from time to time, to see that no gendarmes were
following on their track.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher uttered not a word, but
buried himself in his sorrow. It was not until much
later, when they had reached the village of Tieffenbach,
in one of the gorges of the mountain, that the good
man appeared to recover himself. Then, raising his
broad-brimmed hat, and wiping the perspiration from
his streaming forehead, he said with singular calmness—</p>

<p>“Dear disciple, we have passed through a very rude
trial; let us return thanks to the Demiourgos who, as
ever, has sheltered us beneath his ægis. In vain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
sophists pursue us with their insults, in vain they
multiply obstacles and ambush themselves upon our
path; all that but serves the better to exhibit the protection
of the Being of Beings, who builds on us the
fairest hopes.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Doctor,” replied Coucou Peter;
“when people can perform miracles like us they have
nothing to fear. Before six months are over, I’ll re-enter
Haslach in a bishop’s hat on a white horse; I’ll
have two chorister-boys to carry the skirt of my robe,
and others to burn incense under my nose; but, in the
meanwhile, I think there will be no harm in our learning
where we are going.”</p>

<p>“Let not that distress you, my dear friend,” replied
the illustrious philosopher; “we shall always find room
enough before us. If we have not hitherto been successful,
it is because we require a vaster theatre! You
must observe that Providence has conducted us, in some
measure against our inclinations, towards the larger
towns; let us go to Saverne!”</p>

<p>“To Saverne!—mind what you are about! Saverne’s
a town full of lawyers and gendarmes!”</p>

<p>The good apostle said that because he had left his
wife at Saverne, to say nothing of numerous debts to
the brewers and publicans in general throughout the
town; but the illustrious Doctor listened to none of
these objections.</p>

<p>“Gendarmes are made for thieves,” he said, “and
not for philosophers; let us go forward, Coucou Peter,
let us go forward; every moment of our existence
belongs to human kind.”</p>

<p>They passed down the silent street of Tieffenbach;
most of the inhabitants were away at the fair of Haslach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
and the small houses with their closed doors,
their little gardens surrounded with disjointed palings,
and their solitary moss-grown wells, had a melancholy
look, very different from holiday gaiety and animation.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter appeared thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Maître Frantz,” he said, “can rabbis marry?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, my friend; it is a duty even, imposed
on them by Moses, for the propagation of the species.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the Chief Rabbi of the Peregrination of
Souls?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Marriage is in the order of nature;
I see nothing objectionable in it.”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter immediately appeared in better spirits.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he said, “we were wrong to worry ourselves.
The first thing we will do on reaching Saverne
is to go to my wife; she must have saved something
during five months.”</p>

<p>“Your wife!”</p>

<p>“Eh!—yes; my wife, Gredel Baltzen, married to
Coucou Peter before the mayor and pastor of the town.”</p>

<p>“You never told me that.”</p>

<p>“Because you never asked me about it.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t live together?”</p>

<p>“No; she’s too thin—I like fat women—I can’t help
it—it was born in me.”</p>

<p>“But then, why did you marry her?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t then come to know my own taste; I was
at the age of innocence, and this girl wheedled me.
At last—this is how it was; seeing her every day
growing thinner and thinner, I said to myself, Coucou
Peter, you’re not of the same race, you’ll make a bad
mixture; you’ll do better to take yourself off. So I
took what there was in the cupboard and went off.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Conscience before everything; it would have been too
painful to have become the parent of skinny children;
I sacrificed myself.”</p>

<p>This avowal surprised the illustrious philosopher;
but he was touched by the delicacy of his disciple, and
more than all by his admirable anthropo-zoological
sentiments.</p>

<p>“My friend,” he said, “I cannot but approve the
motive of your conduct. If, however, your wife was
unhappy——”</p>

<p>“Bah, Maître Frantz! she was only too glad to be
rid of me. We could never agree! when I said white
she said black; and that sort of thing always ended by
the use of the stick. Besides, what is she in want of?
She is servant to Pastor Schweitzer, one of my old
Strasbourg comrades, of the time when I was employed
at a beerhouse and he was studying theology. How many
times have I taken him into the cellar! March beer!
strong beer! foaming beer! we passed all the barrels in
review. Ha! ha! ha! I can’t help laughing when I
think of it! But to return to my wife; she has twelve
francs a month, board and lodging, with nothing to do
but look after the house, mend the linen, make the
soup, and read the children a chapter out of the Bible
every evening, while the pastor smokes his pipe and
takes his mug of beer at the casino. What woman
wouldn’t be happy leading such a life, especially as
the pastor is a widower, and has never got married
again?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Mathéus, absently, “certainly;
she must be very happy.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the end of the village,
and the illustrious philosopher observed a knot of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
women gesticulating about some object lying on the
ground.</p>

<p>The miller, a little man with hanging cheeks, a grey
cap on his head, and white with flour from head to foot,
was leaning on his door and speaking with remarkable
animation.</p>

<p>In spite of the tic-tac of the mill, and the noise of the
water rushing through the sluice, he could be heard
exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Let them go to the devil! It’s no business of
mine!”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz and Coucou Peter went to see what
was the matter. When they had come within a few
paces the women moved away, and Mathéus saw an old
gipsy woman lying against the wall, and apparently at
the point of death. This old woman was so wrinkled
and decrepid that she might have been a hundred years
old; she said nothing, but a young gipsy on his knees
beside her besought the miller to receive her into his
barn.</p>

<p>The arrival of Mathéus had somewhat moderated this
man’s rage.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, in a calmer tone; “the old woman
might die, and all the expense of burying her would fall
on me.”</p>

<p>The illustrious doctor, grieved at such a spectacle,
went up to the door, and stooping towards the miller
said gently to him—</p>

<p>“My friend, how can you refuse shelter to this unfortunate
creature? Reflect that she may die for want of
assistance. To what reproaches would you not subject
yourself in the country around! Come, allow yourself
to be moved by the prayer of this poor child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“Monsieur le curé,” replied the miller, taking off his
cap, “if they were Christians, I wouldn’t refuse; but
pagans—I can’t stand that!”</p>

<p>“What matters their philosophical opinions?” cried
Maître Frantz. “Are we not all brothers? Have we
not all the same wants, the same passions, the same
origin? Believe me, my worthy man, give a truss of
straw to this unhappy creature, and you will be fulfilling
your duty, and the Being of Beings will recompense you
for it.”</p>

<p>All the women sided with Mathéus, and the miller,
for fear of provoking scandal, opened his barn; but he
did it with so many maledictions against these vagabonds,
who compelled the world to support them while
they lived, and to bury them when they died, that no
credit was due to him for his charitable action.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter noticed all this with his hands in his
pockets and without speaking a word; but when Mathéus
bowed to the good women and rode on his way, he suddenly
asked—</p>

<p>“Maître Frantz, do you believe that old woman is
very ill?”</p>

<p>“I fear so,” answered the good man, shaking his
head. “I fear she will not live through the night.”</p>

<p>“Yet you saw how she got up without assistance when
the barn was opened for her.”</p>

<p>“That is true, and I am still astonished at it,” replied
Mathéus. “These gipsies must have very tough lives!
It comes of the sober and primitive existence they lead
in the midst of forests. They know nothing of the
excesses of the table, neither of drink nor of labour, so
injurious to other men. Thus lived our first parents.”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter could not help smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“Maître Frantz,” he said, “with all due respect to
you, I know enough of the gipsies to know that they
never disdain anything good to eat, and that they drink
a great deal more brandy than we do. As to working,
you are right; they like better doing nothing than
making themselves useful to humankind; not like we,
who work for the future generations. Do you know
what I think of that old woman?”</p>

<p>“What do you think of her, my friend?”</p>

<p>“I think she is no more ill than you or I; that, after
trying all the doors in the town to see whether they
were well fastened, this old swindler, finding there was
nothing to take, has shammed ill for the purpose of
getting into the mill. During the night she and the
boy with her will get up quietly, creep into the fowl-house,
wring the necks of the fowls, turkeys, and ducks,
and to-morrow, before daylight, she’ll have vanished!
That’s my notion.”</p>

<p>“How can you bring yourself to think such things?”
cried the illustrious philosopher. “Oh, Coucou Peter!
Coucou Peter! it’s very wrong to conceive such ideas
against an entire race of men because those men have a
skin a little yellower than our own, thicker lips, and
brighter eyes!”</p>

<p>“No, Maître Frantz; it’s because they all without
exception belong to the family of foxes,” said Coucou
Peter, gravely.</p>

<p>“But will—cannot will change their evil instincts?”
cried Mathéus, surprised to find himself embarrassed
by his own system. “Are not all men perfectible?
Are they to be considered as brutes? Doubtless they
have animal appetites, which come to them from their
original nature, but the Great Demiourgos has given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
them at birth a superior faculty—moral sense—which
enables them to distinguish the just from the unjust,
and to combat instincts incompatible with the dignity
of man.”</p>

<p>“That would be all very well,” said Coucou Peter,
“if I hadn’t known this old gipsy. It is not for nothing
that her companions call her the Black Magpie;
the older she grows the more she likes other people’s
property. I’m sure that, after her death, the Being
of Beings will send her back with crooked fingers, as a
reward for her good actions.”</p>

<p>“But if that is the case, let us return to the village
and warn the miller.”</p>

<p>“Bah! what is the use of our mixing ourselves up in
matters that do not concern us? Besides, in the first
place, I’m not sure she may not be ill; in the next
place, this miller is not a bit better than she, for he is
the greatest stealer of flour I know. If the Black
Magpie wrings the necks of his fowls, he has crunched
the bones of many others. We need not trouble ourselves
about that, Maître Frantz. I only wanted to
tell you that these gipsies are of another race than
ourselves; still this justice must be done them—that
they never attack people on the road; they like to eat
and drink at the expense of others, and, good faith, in
that respect, they are not unlike some other people!”</p>

<p>While this conversation was proceeding, the illustrious
philosopher and his disciple advanced farther and farther
into the forest. Coucou Peter believed himself sure of
the path, every moment expecting to see the house of
the gamekeeper Yorich, one of his old comrades, where
he proposed passing the night. But at the end of an
hour, nothing coming in sight, doubts crossed his mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
as to the direction of the road, though he said nothing
to Mathéus on the subject. After going on for another
half-hour, the path becoming narrower and narrower,
he no longer doubted having missed his way. It was
about seven o’clock; brambles and thorns attached
themselves to the clothes of Mathéus and his disciple;
at length the path disappeared entirely, and lost itself
in the midst of tall bushes.</p>

<p>“I say, Maître Frantz,” then said the fiddler, “are
you quite sure of this road?”</p>

<p>“Of this road!” cried Mathéus, stopping abruptly, “I
don’t know it at all.”</p>

<p>“Then we are in a nice fix!—and I’ve been letting
you lead me! What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“Let us go back,” said the good man.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t more than half an hour’s daylight
before us, and we’ve come two leagues from Tieffenbach;
on the contrary, let us push forward—still forward;
we must arrive somewhere.”</p>

<p>They then looked at each other in silence, in the
greatest uncertainty. The missel-thrushes called to
each other from the tops of the pines; the setting sun
spread its yellow hues on the foliage; the dull roar of
the torrent in the valley was heard. They had remained
for several minutes without exchanging a word, when
Coucou Peter exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Hark, Maître Frantz;—do you hear nothing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear voices down there,” said the good man,
pointing to the valley.</p>

<p>“And I fancy I smell smoke,” replied Coucou Peter.
“Sniff, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“I think it is so,” said the illustrious philosopher.</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure of it now,” cried the disciple; “we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
are not far from a charcoal-burner’s. Which way does
the wind come?—That way—forward!”</p>

<p>They had hardly gone fifty paces in the direction
indicated, before they entered a deep valley, right opposite
to where a troop of gipsies were preparing their
cookery on the hillside.</p>

<p>“Hey!” cried Coucou Peter, “we shan’t want for
supper, Maître Frantz—we shan’t want for supper!”</p>

<p>They walked towards the gipsies, who were much
surprised to see a man on horseback in the depth of
this solitude.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

</div>

<p>The nearer Frantz Mathéus approached the gipsies,
the more he was struck by their joyous and truly
philosophical appearance. It was easy to be seen that
they cared little for the opinion of the world, and that
they drew all their satisfaction from themselves. Some
had clothes too large, others clothes much too small;
there were many more rents than whole pieces in their
breeches, but that did not prevent them extending their
legs with a certain nobility of action, or of looking you
in the face as if they had been covered with magnificent
embroideries. Almost all the women had children upon
their backs in a kind of bag, which they carried slung
over their shoulders. They went quietly about their
business; some put wood on the fire, others lit their
pipes with a hot coal; others, again, emptied their
pockets, filled with crusts of bread, carrots, and turnips,
into the cauldron. It was exquisitely picturesque to see
this halt in the midst of the woods. The blue smoke
rolled in masses through the valley, and in the distance
the frogs, enjoying themselves amid the duckweed, were
commencing their melancholy concert.</p>

<p>“Eat and drink, worthy people!” cried Mathéus,
taking off his broad-brimmed felt and saluting them;
“all the fruits of the earth are made for man. Ah!
how I love to see Heaven’s creatures prosper and spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
before the face of the Great Demiourgos! How I love
to see them grow in strength, in wisdom, and in
beauty!”</p>

<p>The gipsies looked suspiciously at the illustrious philosopher;
but hardly had they set eyes on Coucou
Peter than several of them jumped up, crying—</p>

<p>“Coucou Peter!—eh! It’s Coucou Peter come to
have some of our soup!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve come for,” said the merry
fiddler, shaking hands all round. “Good evening,
Wolf; good evening, Pfifer-Karl! Hallo! Is that
you, Daniel? How are you? And you, my little
Nightingale, how long have you had this chick? My
eyes! how everything increases and multiplies! Let’s
see if he’s the right kind: black eyes, curly hair.
Very good! all as it should be, and nobody can say a
word in objection, Nightingale. Gipsies with blue eyes
always strike me as deucedly suspicious; they are like
warren rabbits that taste of cabbage-leaf.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” cried the gipsies, pressing about
him; “Coucou Peter has always his joke!”</p>

<p>While this little scene was passing, Mathéus tied
Bruno to one of the neighbouring trees; when he
turned round Coucou Peter was bending over the
cauldron.</p>

<p>“There’s no meat in the soup to-day,” he said,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the Nightingale; “we are fasting in
honour of Saint Florent.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Coucou Peter; “a little patience—a
little patience; all the troop are not together yet.”</p>

<p>Then turning towards Mathéus—</p>

<p>“No ceremony here, Maître Frantz,” he cried; “sit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
you down by the fire, and make yourself at home.
And you there, don’t let your hands stray into the
pockets of the illustrious philosopher.”</p>

<p>“Do you take us for thieves?” asked a young gipsy,
dressed in a long overcoat that hung down to his heels.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Melchior, I look on you as the
most honest people in the universe; only you have
crooked fingers, and, in spite of yourselves, something
is always hanging itself on to them.”</p>

<p>Mathéus slowly approached and looked closely at the
gipsies.</p>

<p>“Like the most virtuous Aristides,” he said, in a
grave tone, “an object of party hatred and victim to
the ingratitude of my fellow-citizens, I come to seat
myself by the fireside of a foreign nation, and to demand
of you the sacred rights of hospitality. Happy
is he who lives in solitude, in face of the immense
heavens and of the boundless forests; he there sees not
vice triumphant and virtue humiliated; his heart is
not corrupted by selfishness nor withered by envy.
Happiest of all is he who believes in eternal justice, for
he will not be disappointed, but will receive the reward
of his labours, of his courage, of his virtue!”</p>

<p>So spoke the good man; then, after seating himself
by the fire, he appeared to lose himself in an abyss of
meditations.</p>

<p>The astonished gipsies looked at one another, and
asked, in whispers, who this man was, and what was
the meaning of what he had been saying.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter thereupon undertook to relate to them
the distant peregrinations of the illustrious philosopher,
and the vicissitudes of his journey; but they could
make nothing of it. Pfifer-Karl, the trombone, asked—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“What does he want to do? What is he going about
the world for? If he has got a house of his own and
lands, and all that he needs, why doesn’t he stop at
home?—or, if he’s fond of travelling, why doesn’t he
sell one of his fields to pay his travelling expenses?”</p>

<p>These worthy people could not in the least understand
what it was to be a prophet; they laughed at
Coucou Peter’s explanations, and as the illustrious
Doctor did not stir from where he was sitting, and
could not hear them, Coucou Peter finished by laughing
at them himself.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! you rascal, Pfifer-Karl!” he cried,
slapping the trombone on the shoulder, “you are no
fool—it isn’t you who would go about working for
future generations! Ha! ha! ha!—it’s a funny idea
all the same!”</p>

<p>The gipsies strongly pressed him to take up his
fiddle again and go with them to the fair; for they had
made more than one round with him in Alsace, and
knew that he was everywhere well received. But he
would not abandon the doctrine.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I am a prophet, and I shall remain
a prophet; it is a long time since I played any music.
Besides, if I were to find out later that anybody else
had taken my place of Grand Rabbi, I should tear my
hair in despair. No, no—I want to get myself talked
about; I want the name of Coucou Peter to be like
that of Pythagoras.”</p>

<p>“When there’s a fool anywhere about he is always
more talked of than all the sensible people in the
country,” said Pfifer-Karl.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Coucou Peter, laughing; “but fools
of a new kind are rare. They are like six-legged sheep.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
They are well fed, and shown for money, while the
others are led shorn. I wish I had a leg in the middle
of my back—my fortune would be made; people would
come from the ends of the earth to see me.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cauldron went on steaming and began
to give out a most agreeable odour. They gathered
round the fire, and the Nightingale, having washed her
porringer at a neighbouring spring, offered it to Coucou
Peter. He refused it, saying that he had dined too
well to drink carrot-soup. Mathéus withdrew from the
circle and said he was sleepy; stale crusts of bread
floating in clear water did not tempt his appetite.</p>

<p>The night was dark. Coucou Peter lit his pipe and
watched the gipsies eating their portions, the porringer
passing from hand to hand, each drinking out of it in
his turn.</p>

<p>Maître Frantz had seated himself on the heather.
For some time the good man’s looks were turned to the
dark valley; he listened to the roar of a distant waterfall,
which sometimes seemed to pause, and then slowly
to increase again, like the noise of a storm. The entire
valley responded to that solemn voice; the leaves
sighed, the birds chirped, the trees waved their black
tops.</p>

<p>Suddenly a young gipsy began to sing a mountain
ditty, which said—</p>

<p>“Away, gipsies, away! See, see! the sun is rising
behind the woods! Take up your bag and pass along
the great alley of trees to the village. It is long, that
alley to the village; you must set off early to arrive
there in the morning-time.”</p>

<p>This child-voice faded in the immense valley—echoes
answered it from afar—from very far off, in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
tenderer tone. Some women joined the child, seated
near the fire, their hands interlaced in front of their
knees, and they sang in chorus; then the men joined
in the song, which was thus continually swelled with—“Away,
gipsies, away.”</p>

<p>Insensibly Mathéus’ head drooped; at length he
stretched himself on the moss and sank into a profound
sleep.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

</div>

<p>The next day Mathéus awoke at an early hour; a heavy
dew was falling, and slowly penetrating his brown
greatcoat; the air was calm, and the valley misty.</p>

<p>The gipsies, already stirring, were preparing to start
on their way before daylight; they were loading themselves
with their cauldron, their trombone, their French-horns,
and their big drum; the women arranged their
bags on their shoulders; the children settled down on
the backs of their mothers. The vague murmur of the
rain falling on the leaves of the trees alone broke the
silence of the forest.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, moist as a duck, had not quitted his
place by the fire; he was stirring some potatoes in the
ashes, and appeared melancholy.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pfifer-Karl to him, “if you want to go
with us make up your mind.”</p>

<p>“No; I must go and preach at Saverne.”</p>

<p>“Good luck to you, then, comrade—good luck to you!”</p>

<p>The Nightingale also shook hands with him. The
whole band then started on its way. It moved away
slowly through the tall woods; pale rays illumined the
horizon, rain streaked the air; the gipsies were not
depressed by it, but went on laughing and talking
amongst themselves.</p>

<p>“Good journey to you,” cried Coucou Peter.</p>

<p>Several turned and waved their hats; and soon all
of them had disappeared in the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Coucou Peter then noticed the illustrious philosopher,
who was sheltering himself under the turned-down
brim of his wide hat.</p>

<p>“Hey, Maître Frantz!” he cried; “the blessing of
the Being of Beings will make us grow in strength,
wisdom, and beauty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my good fellow,” replied Mathéus, “every day
adds new trials and new merits to our glorious enterprise.”</p>

<p>He said this in a tone so gentle and resigned, that
Coucou Peter felt touched by it.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he said, “come here and taste my potatoes;
they are as floury as chestnuts.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure—with pleasure,” replied the good
man, seating himself beside his disciple.</p>

<p>“Gipsies are worthy people,” he said, taking a
potato; “they think not of gathering together empty
riches, but, living from day to day like the birds of the
air, prefer their independence to all the false gains of
the world. Have you not remarked, my good fellow,
with what philosophical gaiety they eat their carrot-soup?
Truly their way of living is not so disagreeable
as it might be supposed to be.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Maître Frantz,” said Coucou Peter.
“No longer ago than last year I travelled for three
months with this very band; we went about playing
dance-music at all the fairs in Alsace; we slept sometimes
in a barn, sometimes under a rock in the open
air, and I promise you we didn’t live on beech-mast and
pine-cones, like squirrels; we had every day eggs,
sausages, and bacon in abundance!”</p>

<p>“And who gave you all those good things?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Coucou Peter, laughing, “while we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
were playing our music at one end of the village, and
all the women of the place were away at the dance,
Nightingale, Black Magpie, and two or three more,
slipped behind the gardens and into the houses: if they
found anybody at home, they told their fortunes; but
if there was nobody in sight, they nimbly whipped off
the flax from over the fireplace, the bacon from the
chimney; they laid hands on the butter, eggs, bread,
and generally emptied all the cupboards, with the contents
of which they stuffed their big pockets—for they
always have pockets in their petticoats—and then made
off to the woods. Ha! ha! ha! Maître Frantz,” cried
the worthy apostle gaily, “you should have seen the
peasants’ looks when they returned home! Ha! ha!
ha! what faces they pulled! what faces they pulled!
and what bastings they gave their wives! Ha!
ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“How can you laugh?” cried Maître Frantz; “do
you not know that you have led a very criminal life?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I had nothing to do with all that, doctor. I
did nothing but play the fiddle. If the gipsies had been
captured, who could have said anything against me?”</p>

<p>“But you partook of the fruits of their robberies:
can you not distinguish between just and unjust?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I can—and the reason I parted from the
band was because my conscience reproached me; every
time I eat any of those good things, a voice within me
cried, ‘Mind what you are about, Coucou Peter,
mind what you are about, or you may be seized
for a thief, and thrown into prison!’ The repeated
warning of this interior voice made me feel low-spirited,
and every moment I fancied the police were close at my
heels. Fair-time was over, winter was coming on.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
One day the snow was beginning to fall, I put my
violin under my arm, and in spite of the entreaties of
Nightingale, Pfifer-Karl, and the whole band, who
wished me to remain with them, I went back to
Saverne.”</p>

<p>Mathéus said no more, but he withdrew his good
opinion of the gipsies, and even repented having eaten
any of their potatoes.</p>

<p>The sun had risen, and threw a steady light between
the mountains; it was time to be going, and Mathéus
remounted Bruno.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter took hold of the bridle, and ascended
the road leading up the hill, in order to escape from
the mists which filled the valley.</p>

<p>The birds were warbling their joyous morning songs.
The night faded away, and the air became more fresh
and penetrating; the path from Haslach again became
visible amongst the bushes, and Maître Frantz, now
more at his ease, congratulated his disciple on having
parted company with the gipsies.</p>

<p>As they advanced into the forest, the sun became
warmer, and penetrated beneath the foliage; and while
Bruno, at a walking pace, followed the narrow moss-bordered
path, Coucou Peter gathered ripe blackberries,
with which the bushes were laden. His mouth was
blackened with the fruit, and he whistled gaily in
answer to the birds. Jays passed in flights among the
underwood, and more than once the merry fiddler
threw his stick at them, so near did they approach.</p>

<p>Until nine o’clock all went well; but when the full
heat of day came, and the steep sides of the Dagsberg
had to be ascended, an unconquerable melancholy fell
upon the heart of Mathéus. They met not a soul;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
nothing but the murmur of the pines was around them.
The vast pasturages of the valleys, in which were heard
the distant sound of the sheep-bell, and the song of
the young shepherds—now faint, now shrill—awaking
the echoes: everything reminded him of Graufthal, his
old Martha, his absent friends; and heavy sighs arose
from his bosom. Coucou Peter himself, contrary to
his habit, was thoughtful, and Bruno hung his head,
with a melancholy air, as if thinking regretfully of
happier times.</p>

<p>Many times they had to stop to take breath, and it
was not until towards five o’clock in the evening that
they reached the Valley of the Zorn, at the foot of the
Haut-Bârr. Then the sky cleared; above them wound
the road from Lorraine; long lines of vehicles, peasant
men and women, with their large panniers on their
backs filled with vegetables, were passing along; cracking
of whips and tinkling of harness-bells made the
prospect pleasant, and seemed to announce the proximity
of Zabern, the little town notable for its white
bread, sausages, and foaming beer. They perceived
it, in fact, at the outlet of the valley, and Bruno,
scenting a resting-place, broke into a vigorous gallop.
On reaching the first houses Mathéus slackened
his pace.</p>

<p>“At length,” he said, “we have come to the end of
our fatigues—the destinies are about to be accomplished!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Maître Frantz and his disciple proudly
entered the ancient Rue des Tanneurs, and, to tell the
truth, an extraordinary animation exhibited itself as
they made their way along. Young and old faces
showed themselves at all the windows, in cornettes, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
three-cornered hats, and in cotton caps; everybody was
curious to see them; the habitués of the casino came
out into the balcony, with billiard-cues or newspapers
in their hands; children returning from school, with
their satchels at their back, followed them; the geese
themselves, walking about the streets and chatting
amongst themselves on indifferent subjects, suddenly
set up a cry of triumph, and flew right away to the
Place de la Licorne.</p>

<p>“You see, Coucou Peter,” said the illustrious philosopher,
“what a sensation our arrival produces;
everywhere we are received with fresh enthusiasm! If
the pastor will only lend us his temple for a day or
two, we are sure of converting the whole town. The
simplest course will then be to establish discussions,
and invite all to make whatever objections may occur
to them. Then from the height of the pulpit I will
rebuke them in a voice of thunder, I will bemoan the
aberrations of the age, I will strike with salutary
terror the unbelievers, the sophists, and most of all the
indifferents—those lepers of society, those worthless
beings, who think of nothing, believe in nothing, and
doubt even their own existence! Oh, impure race!—race
of vipers, given up to sensual enjoyments, you
shall tremble! Yes, you shall tremble at the voice of
Frantz Mathéus, filled with real enthusiasm; you shall
be cast down with wholesome terror, and brought upon
your knees before him! But Frantz Mathéus is not
cruel, and if you will only recognise the transformation
of bodies and the peregrination of souls, if you will
only allow faith to penetrate to the depths of your
withered hearts, all shall be forgiven you!”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his mental excitement, Maître<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Frantz saw clearly what was going on around him; the
sight of men of the law in black robes, walking in front
of the Courthouse, made him thoughtful; and when on
the Place de la Licorne, a kind of sergent-de-ville, in a
large flap hat and with a stick under his arm, looked
after them, the hare-like nature of the illustrious philosopher
at once revealed itself, and he remembered
that he had no passport. Fortunately they had reached
the Rue des Capucins, and found themselves in front of
the parsonage.</p>

<p>“Halt!” cried Coucou Peter; “here’s our inn!”</p>

<p>“Heaven be thanked!” said Mathéus; “we’ve had a
long trot to-day.”</p>

<p>He alighted from the saddle, and Coucou Peter,
without the least hesitation, led the horse to the stable.</p>

<p>At that moment the voice of the Pastor Schweitzer
was heard inside the house, exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Twelve louis!—twelve louis! You have lost your
senses, Salomon; a thin cow, not even fresh in milk.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been offered as much for her, Monsieur
Schweitzer.”</p>

<p>“Take it, then, take it, my boy—and thank you for
giving me the preference.”</p>

<p>“Does the pastor deal in cattle?” asked Mathéus.</p>

<p>“He deals a little in everything,” replied Coucou
Peter, smiling; “he’s so worthy a man—you’ll see.”</p>

<p>They crossed the hall, and the discussion between
the pastor and the Jew grew more animated.</p>

<p>“Let us split the difference,” said one.</p>

<p>“You’re making game of me,” cried the other; “ten
louis, not a centime more!”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter paused on the threshold, and Mathéus,
looking over his disciple’s shoulder, saw one of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
lofty rooms of old times, ornamented with oak furniture,
oak panelling, vast cupboards, massive tables, the sight
of which rejoiced the heart. He instantly said: “Here
they eat well, drink well, and sleep well!—the blessing
of the Lord rest upon all good-natured people!”</p>

<p>A little fat man was seated on a leathern arm-chair,
his stomach filling the whole space between his chin
and his legs, and good-humour showing in his rosy
face. Near him was standing a tall lout in a blouse,
his nose hooked, and his hair a fiery red.</p>

<p>“Good day, pastor!” cried the fiddler.</p>

<p>The little man turned and burst into loud laughter.</p>

<p>“Coucou Peter!” he cried. “Ha! ha! ha! where
does he come from? I should have said, ‘Where is he
going?’—the rascal!”</p>

<p>And pushing back the arm-chair, he opened his arms
and endeavoured to draw Coucou Peter to his fat
stomach. It was something touching to see—something
like two Easter-eggs trying to embrace one another; and
it brought tears into Mathéus’ eyes to witness their
endeavours. At length they gave up the attempt; and
Coucou Peter, turning towards Mathéus, cried—</p>

<p>“Pastor, I bring you the illustrious Doctor Mathéus,
the best man in the world and the greatest philosopher
in the universe!”</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome, monsieur!” said the Pastor
Schweitzer, shaking Maître Frantz’s hand. “Be seated.
I am delighted to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>He then sent the Jew away, and hurried to the
kitchen, crying—</p>

<p>“Gredel! Gredel! here’s Coucou Peter!”</p>

<p>Gredel, who was getting supper ready, flew to the door
of the sitting-room; three or four youngsters toddled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
after her, shouting, chattering, and demanding slices of
bread-and-jam.</p>

<p>“Good day, Gredel,” said Coucou Peter, kissing his
wife on both cheeks; “all goes well with you, my little
Gredel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, good-for-nothing, I’m quite well,” she replied,
half laughingly, half seriously. “You’ve come back
because you have not a sou left, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Gredel, be reasonable; I’m only on my
way through this town; it’s not worth making my life
wretched.”</p>

<p>The children hung on to the tail of the fiddler’s coat,
and called him “<i>Nonon</i> Coucou Peter,” to get something
out of him; and the pastor rubbed his hands merrily.</p>

<p>When Coucou Peter had completely cajoled his
little wife, who was, after all, not so thin, and when he
had kissed the children, one after the other, and whispered
to them that his travelling-trunk was filled with
nice things, Gredel returned to the kitchen; and Coucou
Peter, as well as the pastor and Mathéus, seated themselves
before a bottle of old wolxheim.</p>

<p>The whole house wore a holiday aspect; the
children sang, whistled, and ran into the street to
watch for the arrival of the promised travelling-trunk;
the fowls—the necks of which were wrung by Gredel—uttered
piercing cries; Coucou Peter gave an account
of his distant peregrinations, of his title of “Grand
Rabbi,” and of his future prospects; the illustrious
philosopher admired himself in the course of these
marvellous tales; the glasses were filled and emptied,
as if by themselves; and the fat stomach of Pastor
Schweitzer shook merrily at the recital of the innumerable
adventures of his old comrade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!—a good, joke!” he cried; “you’ll
never change, Coucou Peter!—you’ll never change;
nobody makes me laugh like you!”</p>

<p>Night had closed in, and the shadows of the neighbouring
houses had spread themselves in the large
sitting-room, when Gredel brought in lights. She was
about to serve up the supper, and quickly spread a
cloth upon the table, arranged the covers, and distributed
the plates in proper order. Coucou Peter looked
at her admiringly; never had he seen her looking so
fresh, plump, and attractive; he was astonished at
himself for not having before discovered all the merits
of his wife, and, suddenly rising, as if transported with
enthusiasm, he passed his arm round her waist, and
began to waltz with her, crying—</p>

<p>“Hey, Gredel! hey!—off we go!”</p>

<p>“Don’t play the fool!—don’t play the fool!” she cried.</p>

<p>But he paid no attention to what she said, and went
on twirling her round and calling out—</p>

<p>“Hey, Gredel! off we go!” Finally, he gave her a
sounding kiss on the neck, and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“You are my little Gredel—always my good little
Gredel—the prettiest little Gredel I have ever met with
in my life!”</p>

<p>He then returned to his seat, gravely crossed his legs,
and appeared greatly contented with himself for what
he had done.</p>

<p>The children rushed in, crying—</p>

<p>“Nonon Coucou Peter; the trunk has not come!”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it?” he said. “That’s very strange—very
strange; but wait a bit longer, it’s sure to come, quite
sure to come!”</p>

<p>These fair promises did not satisfy them; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
sight of some apple-fritters, tartlets, and hot galette,
which Gredel was placing on the table, restored them to
good temper. Before Mathéus and Coucou Peter had
taken their places, they had seated themselves round
the table, with napkins under their chins; and when
the party was arranged, and the minister in a solemn
tone returned thanks to God for the many excellent
things He had sent into the world for the use of His
children, it was delightful to hear them all cry at once—“Amen!”</p>

<p>The supper passed gaily. Everybody had a good
appetite. Gredel helped the children; Coucou Peter
filled the glasses, and proposed, first, the health of
Maître Frantz—next, that of Pastor Schweitzer. The
illustrious philosopher celebrated the peregrination of
souls, and the pastor eulogised his progeny with tender
benevolence. Fritz was going to be a minister; he
cared for nothing but the Bible; he was a highly-intelligent
child. Wilhelm promised to be admirably fitted
for commerce; and Ludwig could not fail to become a
general, for he played on the fife from morning till
night. Mathéus would not contradict the philosophical
opinions of his host; but he thought they all belonged,
without exception, to the family of the penguins, remarkable
for their short wings, large stomachs, and
insatiable appetites.</p>

<p>It was a very gentle satisfaction for the illustrious
philosopher to see his foresight confirmed on the arrival
of the dessert; these little ones then set to eating cream,
cakes, and tarts with surprising avidity. Fritz cracked
filberts; Wilhelm crammed raisins into his pocket; and
little Ludwig drank Gredel’s wine every time she turned
her head to smile at Coucou Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>At the end of the meal the pastor had his meerschaum
brought him, and, while listening to the address of
Maître Frantz, who was requesting the use of the
temple for the purpose of announcing his doctrine, lit
it; then, throwing himself back in his arm-chair, he
blew a few puffs of smoke into the air, and with the
utmost quietude of manner replied—</p>

<p>“Illustrious philosopher! you are possessed by a truly
affecting philosophic ardour, and it would be a real
pleasure to me to be of service to you. But, as to the
temple, it is not to be thought of; I cannot raise up
against myself the antagonism of such irresistible
eloquence as yours; that is too much to expect of human
weakness. But, thank Heaven, we have a casino at
Saverne—that is to say, a place of reunion for the élite
of society: barristers, judges, procureurs, all
well-informed persons, who will like nothing better than to
listen to you and profit by your instruction. If you
wish it——”</p>

<p>“It is the Being of Beings Himself who has inspired
you with the idea of conducting me to this place!”
cried Mathéus, interrupting him. “There is not a
moment to be lost; the universe has too long trembled
in doubt and uncertainty.”</p>

<p>“Restrain your impatience, illustrious philosopher!”
replied the pastor. “In the first place, it will be as
well to have your boots blacked. I know well that a
superior mind does not trouble itself with such details,
but polished boots can do no harm to your eloquence.
Besides that, Gredel will give your coat a brush, so that
you may conform to the oratorical decorum recommended
by Cicero; by which time I hope to have finished my
pipe, and we will set off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>These judicious considerations decided Mathéus to
moderate his impatience. Coucou Peter brought him
the pastor’s dressing-gown and slippers; Gredel blacked
his boots and brushed his brown coat; Maître Frantz
shaved himself, as he was used to do at Graufthal;
finally, having put on a clean shirt in an adjoining
room, and completed all his preparations, the illustrious
philosopher and the pastor took their way together
towards the casino.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, who stayed with Gredel, followed them
to the door, candle in hand, and wished them all sorts
of good-fortune.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>In passing up the ancient Rue des Capucins, Maître
Frantz felt a real enjoyment from having changed his
shirt and shaved himself; his mind was filled with invincible
arguments, and the moon in a manner went
before him to conduct him to the casino.</p>

<p>A confused murmur announced that the little Chapel
of Saint Jean was full of the faithful; no other sound
was heard in the street; all the women were at worship,
and all the men at the public-house.</p>

<p>Maître Frantz and the pastor proceeded for some
time in silence, inhaling with pleasure the fresh evening
air, so pleasant after a good meal; watching the rapid
light that escapes from a door quickly opened and shut,
a lantern moving in the midst of the darkness, a
shadow appearing behind well-lighted window-panes—in
short, those vague experiences of night so full of
dreamy mystery and inexpressible charm; but, speedily
animated by his anthropo-zoological meditation, the
illustrious philosopher quickened his pace.</p>

<p>“Stay a moment, my dear monsieur—stay a moment,”
said the pastor; “you run like a hare. Give me a
moment to take breath.”</p>

<p>“Will all the company be assembled?” inquired
Mathéus.</p>

<p>“Not yet—not yet; there’s no cause for hurrying.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
What would be said if judges, barristers, and procureurs
were to go to drink and play at midday? It
wouldn’t be respectable; they must wait until the public-houses
are shut up, and set an example of good
morals.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke the pastor, which did not prevent Maître
Frantz Mathéus from pressing forward with lengthened
strides, under the impulsion of new enthusiasm, murmuring
to himself—“Courage, Frantz! Listen not to
the counsels of a false wisdom and of a cowardly love
of repose; the captious windings of sophistry shall
neither bewilder your intelligence nor hinder your
triumphant march.”</p>

<p>The pastor laughed at his precipitation.</p>

<p>“Where are you rushing, my dear monsieur—where
are you rushing?” he cried, on the doorstep of the
casino. “Don’t you see where we are?”</p>

<p>Looking about him, Maître Frantz observed tall
windows shining in the midst of the darkness, with the
figures of dancers flitting across their red curtains.</p>

<p>“It is here,” he thought, “that the regeneration of
mankind is about to be accomplished!”</p>

<p>He was greatly moved by this magnificent idea, but
still greater was his emotion when, the pastor having
opened the door, he beheld a large room illuminated by
a great number of lights. A considerable number of
persons were already assembled. Some were reading
the newspapers; Monsieur le Notaire Creutzer was
playing a game of piquet with Monsieur l’Avocat
Swibel; the noble Baron Pipelnaz, thrown back in a
large arm-chair, was gravely discussing the affairs of
the country; and the young substitute Papler was
chatting and laughing with handsome Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Olympia, the young lady at the refreshment counter.
It was a superb sight, such as Maître Frantz could not
remember to have seen for many years; and when, passing
by one of the gold-framed looking-glasses, he saw
himself standing in the middle of the room in his
brown overcoat, short breeches, and check waistcoat,
he inwardly thanked the pastor for having caused his
boots to be polished and his coat brushed.</p>

<p>The members of the casino had turned their heads
and smiled at sight of the good man; they took him
for a peasant of Upper Alsace, who had lost his way
amid superior spheres, and his air of admiration was
pleasant to them to see; but when the pastor handed
him a seat, and ordered two glasses of beer, they
thought it must be some village clergyman, and each
returned to his former attitude.</p>

<p>The fair Olympia rang her bell, and the two glasses
of beer were served upon a brilliantly-painted lacquered
tray.</p>

<p>How astonished Mathéus must have been by such
magnificence may be imagined; globes of crystal
covered the lamps, and the chairs were covered with
velvet, soft as the fleece of young lambs. Thus it was
that, in spite of his resolute convictions, he could not
help feeling a sort of timidity, natural to those who
find themselves in the presence of the great ones of
the earth.</p>

<p>“Well, illustrious philosopher, do you wish me to
announce your discourse?” asked the gay-hearted
pastor.</p>

<p>“Not just yet,” replied Maître Frantz, almost in a
whisper, while a blush suffused his venerable cheeks—“not
just yet. I have not quite prepared my exordium.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“The deuce! You’ll be some time about it. If
you’ll allow me, I’ll look through this newspaper, and,
when you are ready, you’ll only have to tell me.”</p>

<p>Mathéus nodded affirmatively, and drew from his
pocket the Synopsis of his <i>Anthropo-Zoology</i>.</p>

<p>The good man was not wanting in prudence: on the
contrary, his timid nature, in the course of its successive
transformations, had accustomed itself to prick up its
ears, and it might be said that, under certain circumstances,
he slept with his eyes open. Therefore, all the
while he was looking over the Synopsis, he closely
watched all that was passing in the room, and even listened
attentively to what was being said right and left.</p>

<p>New faces appeared every moment: now Monsieur
Stoffel, the tax-collector, with his double gold chain
and trinkets; now Hospos, the chemist, whose loud
voice was heard out in the entrance-hall; now Monsieur
Seypel, the Garde Général, all the seams of his coat
embroidered with silver. All these gentlemen stopped
for a moment at the bar, and addressed a few sprightly
speeches to the fair Olympia, who tossed her head and
smiled with infinite grace. They then seated themselves
and called for newspapers.</p>

<p>The conversation grew more animated, and turned
upon the ball to be given by Madame la Sous-Préfète
the names of persons who were to be present being
mentioned. It was to be a grand entertainment for the
wind-up of the season. A pâté de Strasbourg had been
sent for. Monsieur le Garde Général smiled significantly.
When partridges and quails were mentioned
to him, he neither said “Yes” nor “No.” Then came
confidences. Cards of invitation were drawn from
waistcoat-pockets!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! <i>you</i> are going, my dear fellow! I’m delighted!”</p>

<p>“And you too!”</p>

<p>Congratulations were exchanged. But what completed
the general satisfaction was to learn from the
noble Baron Pipelnaz the approaching arrival of Monsieur
le Préfet, of the Council of Revision. A thousand
secret connections between this journey and Madame
la Sous-Préfète’s ball were discovered. There was no
doubt whatever that Monsieur le Préfet intended to be
at the ball. What an event! All those who were
invited looked at each other in a sort of ecstasy. To
be at the same ball as Monsieur le Préfet! To take
supper at the same table as Monsieur le Préfet!</p>

<p>Those who had not yet received their cards of invitation
continued their play, exclaiming, “Three kings!
three aces!” very loudly, and as if they had heard
nothing of the conversation. The pastor himself appeared
very grave, and read his newspaper with sustained
attention; but they could not conceal their discomfiture,
which was clearly to be read in their faces.
They were deeply mortified, and greatly to be commiserated.</p>

<p>Small parties of intimate friends were formed to
drink punch and mulled wine. Nothing was talked of
on all sides but the grace of Madame la Sous-Préfète
and the incomparable elegance of her suppers. The
noble Baron Pipelnaz, mayor of the town, enlarged on
the reception he intended to give Monsieur le Préfet.
For twenty years Monsieur le Baron had bowed to him
at the door of the Mairie; but, under circumstances so
flattering, he proposed to go and meet him in full
official costume, and even desired to present to him a
short congratulatory address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>The arrival of the Procureur Kitzig interrupted this
agreeable conversation. He was one of Pastor Schweitzer’s
old comrades of the University of Strasbourg,
and every day they played together a game of “Youker.”
Fashionable society laughed at the vulgar manners of
Procureur Kitzig, who did not know how properly to
keep up his rank, and talked familiarly with anybody
he happened to meet. Nobody ventured to do this to
his face, however. Maître Kitzig occupied a high
position at Saverne. Besides, who could be sure that
at some time or other he might not have some little
business or other with Monsieur le Procureur? Everybody,
therefore, smiled on Monsieur le Procureur, who
replied by a nod or a few significant words.</p>

<p>“You are very good, Monsieur le Procureur. You
are too kind, Monsieur le Procureur.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! What a farce!” whispered the
pastor in Mathéus’s ear; “what a farce! Have you
ever seen anything like it at Graufthal?”</p>

<p>But the illustrious philosopher made no answer. He
had recognised in Maître Kitzig an individual of the
canine race, for whom hares feel a very singular veneration.</p>

<p>At the end of a few moments Monsieur le Procureur
joined his friend Schweitzer, shook hands with him,
and bowed to Mathéus.</p>

<p>“Well, Karl,” he said, seating himself, “shall we
have our game of ‘Youker’ this evening? I shall be
glad of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready, Michel.”</p>

<p>“Imagine,” Maître Kitzig went on—“I’ve done
nothing since five o’clock but listen to witnesses, and
God knows if others may not be coming from the fair!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“From the fair at Haslach?” asked the pastor, looking
at Mathéus.</p>

<p>“Yes; pretty things have been going on there. Two
scoundrels have been disturbing the population from
top to bottom by their incendiary preaching. They
have attacked laws, morals, and religion—even performed
miracles! It’s a Court of Assize affair.”</p>

<p>“And if they fall into the hands of justice?”</p>

<p>“They won’t get out of my hands for less than
twenty years at the galleys,” replied Kitzig, absorbing
a pinch of snuff with the utmost indifference. “But
we’ve nothing to do with that just now. Cards—and a
slate!”</p>

<p>Never had Frantz Mathéus found himself in so terrible
a position. His first impulse was to denounce himself,
and to defend the doctrine in the face of nations;
but at this idea his hair rose on the nape of his neck.
He looked towards the door, and remained motionless.</p>

<p>On his side the pastor was not too much at ease.
However, he had presence of mind enough to say—</p>

<p>“Allow me to present to you Doctor Mathéus, of
Graufthal, returning from the Scientific Congress at
Bâle.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the procureur, shuffling the cards. “On
his way back to Graufthal—he must have passed through
Haslach, then?”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz thought he should have fallen backwards;
but fortunately his tongue, so to speak, rejoined
of its own accord—</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Monsieur le Procureur,” he said—“I
came by way of Molsheim.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s vexatious; we might have got some
useful information from you,” said Maître Kitzig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>He then dealt the cards, and the game began.</p>

<p>What a position for Maître Frantz! at the moment
of gaining the most magnificent oratorical triumph, and
of proclaiming the system, to be obliged to remain
silent—of denying the doctrine—of concealing himself
like a criminal! For the more he thought of giving
himself up, the more his natural instincts opposed themselves
to such a course, and in his trouble he cried—</p>

<p>“O poor Mathéus!—poor Mathéus!—to what extremities
are you reduced! To go to the galleys at your
time of life!—poor Mathéus! What fault of yours can
have merited so sad a fate? Have you not sacrificed
your repose, your dearest affections, for the happiness of
humankind? Poor Mathéus!”</p>

<p>His heart wept, and his whole being trembled; but
he had not strength enough to give himself up: he was
afraid.</p>

<p>When, after the first hand had been played, Maître
Kitzig said to him, absently, that he must necessarily
have passed through Haslach, as the road from Molsheim
passed immediately behind that village, he denied
it afresh—denied it emphatically; saying that he had
passed at the back of Hirchland, and giving a false
description of the route and of the beauties of nature,
describing an immense circuit around Oberbronn,
Eschenbach, and generally of all the places through
which he had passed.</p>

<p>“You took a very long and roundabout road?” remarked
the procureur; the game then went on without
interruption.</p>

<p>From time to time Maître Kitzig made some caustic
reflection as to the difficulty of mountain roads, as to
the danger of preaching new doctrines, and the illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
philosopher trembled to the marrow of his bones.
Thus passed this evening, which was to have decided
the eternal glory of Frantz Mathéus, of the progress of
civilisation, and of the happiness of future races; it
passed in the cruellest of torments. While joy was all
around the good man, while the noble Baron de Pipelnaz
was blooming in his pride, and all these vulgar
beings were lapping themselves in the most radiant
hopes: he, so good, so just, so benevolent, was thinking
of nothing but of flight—of going and enriching
America with the treasures of his science! “There,”
he thought, “doctrines are free; no procureurs or
gendarmes are to be feared; everybody may perform
miracles as they like!”</p>

<p>Midnight struck, and a goodly number of the habitués
of the casino had already retired, when the Procureur
Kitzig rose, and, looking at the illustrious philosopher,
said—</p>

<p>“Surely, my dear monsieur, you have made a
mistake; you <i>must</i> have come into the road at the
back of Haslach, and passed through the village?”</p>

<p>Frantz Mathéus, as if carried away by anger, declared
for the third time, with an oath, that he did not know
what was meant—that he had never been that way!</p>

<p>His emotion would certainly have betrayed him if he
had not had the most honest face in the world. But
how could it be supposed that this good Daddy Mathéus,
Doctor of Graufthal, was that terrible reformer, that
great offender, who had conceived the audacious design
of shaking the universe? Such an idea could not have
come into any one’s head; so Maître Kitzig contented
himself with laughing at the worthy man’s singular
excitement, and wishing him “Good evening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>The pastor and Maître Frantz were the last to leave,
and when they were in the street, the Doctor, feeling
the full force of his weakness, burst into tears.
In vain did Monsieur Schweitzer seek to console him
with kind words—he could not forgive himself; and if
his host had not supported him, he would not have
been able to move a step, so choked was he by emotion,
so much did he tremble in all his limbs.</p>

</div>

<p>When Frantz Mathéus and the pastor reached the
house, everybody there was asleep. The pastor, leaving
Mathéus at the door of the sitting-room, went into
the kitchen, and returned after a few minutes with a
light.</p>

<p>Calmness had succeeded the good man’s agitation;
he mechanically followed his host, who conducted him
to a little bedroom on the first-floor, looking into the
parsonage garden.</p>

<p>The tops of the trees beat gently against the windows;
the linen on the bed was of surprising whiteness; and
the old oaken furniture seemed to welcome him with an
air of naïve familiarity. But, in his sadness, the
illustrious philosopher remarked none of these details,
but sat down, uttering a profound sigh.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear monsieur,” said the pastor, “forget
the little annoyances of the philosophical career; have
a good sleep, and to-morrow you will be as fresh and
active as if you had achieved the most magnificent
victory.”</p>

<p>He shook Maître’s Frantz’s hand, placed the candle
on the table, and then went quietly to rest after his
fatigues.</p>

<p>When the pastor’s steps could no longer be heard,
and the silence of night reigned throughout the house,
Mathéus, with his elbows resting on the table and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
head between his hands, sat watching the burning of
the candle with an indescribably downcast air; he was
thinking of nothing, and yet he was sad—sad as if the
Great Demiourgos had abandoned him!</p>

<p>About one o’clock he heard a child crying in a neighbouring
house, and the mother trying to hush it with
tender words. That child-voice, so weak and soft—that
mother’s voice, more gentle still—touched the good
man’s heart, and a tear moistened his eyes. The child
being at length appeased, the silence became more
profound, and Maître Frantz, overcome by fatigue,
ended by falling asleep with his forehead on the table.</p>

<p>When he awoke, daylight was beginning to show
itself at the windows, and the candle was flaring in a
red flame from the hollow of the candlestick. All the
events of the night then returned to his memory. He
rose and opened the window.</p>

<p>The birds were already warbling in the garden; some
labourers, with pickaxe on shoulder, chatted as they
passed the gate, their voices, at this early hour, being
heard from one end of the street to the other. Milk-sellers
from Dagsberg, with their large tin cans under
their arms, were sitting about on neighbouring posts,
and servants, short-petticoated and bare-armed, were
coming one by one to buy milk for their houses. All
these worthy people had a look of health pleasant to
see. The servant-girls stopped to gossip about christenings,
marriages, and the departure of the conscripts;
and the tradespeople opened their shops and hung out
their goods at their doors. Some fresh event happened
every moment; then the mountain-air came down so
fresh and pure, that the chest expanded with pleasure,
and, as it were, breathed by itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>Maître Frantz, inspirited by this cheerful sight,
began to see things from a more agreeable point of
view; he was, in fact, astonished at himself for his
groundless fears, for no one could possibly forbid him
to teach a doctrine founded on the highest morality and
the soundest logic. A very little was needed to make him
seriously determined to denounce himself to the procureur;
but his prudence showed him that he might,
in the first place, be shut up in prison, pending inquiry
into the doctrine, and this judicious reflection cooled
his enthusiasm. “Frantz Mathéus,” he said to himself,
“you are possessed of too great a psychological ardour.
Doubtless it would be delightful to suffer persecution
and martyrdom for immutable truth; it would be <i>very</i>
delightful—but what end would it serve? If you are
put in prison, who will preach anthropo-zoology to the
human race? It could not be done by Coucou Peter,
a man with little faith, and naturally inclined to the
enjoyments of the flesh. It will be better for you to go—it
is wisdom that directs you! Above all, Frantz, be
on your guard against your extraordinary audacity—true
courage consists in conquering one’s passions!”</p>

<p>When the illustrious philosopher had come to this
moral understanding with himself, he resolved to set off
at once to Strasbourg without a moment’s loss of time.
Consequently he put on his wide-brimmed hat and
descended on tiptoe to the hall. But, as he was passing
the door of a small room under the stairs, and hesitated
for an instant, not knowing whether to turn to right or
left, the voice of his disciple called to him from the
interior—</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“It is I, my friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! is it you, Doctor?”</p>

<p>At the same time, Mathéus heard some one get out of
bed, and Coucou Peter, in his shirt, appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>“What the deuce are you doing about so early?”
cried the merry fiddler.</p>

<p>“There’s good reason for it,” Mathéus replied. “You
do not know what I learned yesterday, at the casino—that
we are being pursued!”</p>

<p>“Pursued!” cried Coucou Peter, pushing back his
nightcap on to the nape of his neck; “pursued—by
whom?”</p>

<p>“By the gendarmes.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“For preaching the doctrine.”</p>

<p>“The doctrine! Ah, the scoundrels! I see how
it is: they’re afraid of losing their places; because if
we were the masters, it is we who would be the
rabbis.”</p>

<p>“That’s it! They threaten us with the galleys.”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter stood with wide-open eyes and mouth.
At the same time a voice, from the depths of the room,
cried—</p>

<p>“In Heaven’s name, save yourself, Peter!—fly!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Gredel—don’t be alarmed,” said
the fiddler. “Poor little woman, how she loves me!
We’ll be off at once. The galleys! Ah, the rascals!—Where
shall we go, Maître Frantz?”</p>

<p>“To Strasbourg.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s go to Strasbourg. Gredel, get up and
make us some breakfast. Go back to your room,
Maître Frantz; in five minutes I shall be ready.”</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher returned to his chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and Coucou Peter shortly rejoined him, buttoning on
his braces.</p>

<p>“My wife is already in the kitchen, Maître Frantz,”
he said; “I’ll go and saddle Bruno, and in less than
an hour we shall be off.”</p>

<p>Mathéus, however, returned in the course of a few
minutes, to tell him what had passed on the previous
night. Coucou Peter learned with pleasure
that they were being sought in the neighbourhood of
Haslach.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said—“good! We need not be in a
hurry, but may get our breakfast quietly.”</p>

<p>Together they went down into the kitchen, and found
Gredel cooking steaks on the gridiron and preparing the
coffee.</p>

<p>The grey hues of morning were spreading through
the kitchen, the fire crackled, thousands of glittering
sparks flew up the black chimney, and Maître Frantz
sat gravely contemplating the scene and thinking of
Graufthal.</p>

<p>At the end of a quarter of an hour, Coucou Peter
returned and reported that Bruno had eaten his feed of
oats with visible satisfaction. Then, turning to his
wife, “Give me your best knife, Gredel,” he said; “I
want it.”</p>

<p>“What do you want with it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You’ll see—you’ll see presently.”</p>

<p>As soon as he had got the knife, he raised himself
upon the hearth, and seizing a smoked sausage, as thick
as his arm, hanging in the chimney, cut it in two; he
then did the same with a ham, and appeared highly
satisfied with his labour.</p>

<p>“If we are forced to take to the woods, Maître<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Frantz,” he said, “we’ll not be driven to eat mast like
Saint Antoine.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s not you, you rogue, who will ever die of
hunger!” cried his wife; “you’d pawn your breeches
first!”</p>

<p>“How well you know me, Gredel!—how well you
know me!” cried the gay fiddler, kissing her affectionately.</p>

<p>He then went out to put his provisions in a haversack.</p>

<p>“Is it really true, Doctor,” asked Gredel, as soon as he
was out of hearing, “that you wish to make him Chief
Rabbi of the peregrination of souls? The fact is, he
has told me so many stories, that I can’t now believe
anything he says.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child, it is true,” said the good man;
“your husband, notwithstanding his gay humour and
natural lightness of character, has a good heart; I am
fond of him, and he will succeed me in the government
of souls.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, “I know that he’s a good fellow,
and an honest one; but he is so light—he’s given me a
deal of uneasiness, the rascal! I can’t help loving him,
all the same; for he has his good side, if one can only
get at it.”</p>

<p>“Well said—well said, my child!” said Mathéus,
touched by Gredel’s naïve answer; “Coucou Peter
will yet do you honour; he will be spoken of in distant
ages.”</p>

<p>Proud at hearing this, Gredel hastened to lay the
cloth in the dining-room, and Coucou Peter having
again come in, they made a hearty breakfast of bread-and-butter,
coffee, and steaks. Monsieur Schweitzer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
hearing the clatter of glasses, came down hurriedly in
his breeches, and, seeing the party at table, burst into
a loud fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“Very good!—very good!” he cried. “I’m glad to
see you are quite yourself again!”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz at once explained to him his approaching
departure.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear monsieur,” said the pastor, seating
himself, “in spite of the great pleasure I should have
felt in keeping you longer here, I cannot but approve
your prudence. Kitzig would be sure to find you out,
and all his affection for me would not prevent your
being involved in a most unpleasant piece of business.
Things being so, let us have a glass together. Gredel,
here is the key of the little cellar; bring a bottle from
under the firewood.”</p>

<p>Every one ate and drank with a good appetite. Maître
Frantz was sorry to leave such worthy people; but,
about six, the time had come to separate. The good
man embraced the pastor; Coucou Peter kissed his
wife, who shed tears at parting with the rascal. They
were conducted to the yard, where Bruno was in waiting.
Mathéus being mounted, the Pastor Schweitzer
shook him warmly by the hand, and Gredel could not
detach herself from Coucou Peter’s neck. At length
they departed, amid the blessings and good wishes of
the whole family.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h3>

</div>

<p>Maître Frantz and his disciple passed quickly
through the town. The little houses scattered along the
roadsides rapidly succeeded one another, with their
barns, stables, and wooden steps with washing hanging
upon them—ruddy-faced children asked alms, and old
inquisitive women put their nodding heads out of the
upper windows. At the end of a quarter of an hour
they were in the country, breathing the free air, passing
between two rows of chestnut-trees, listening to the
song of the birds, and thinking still of the worthy
Pastor Schweitzer, by whom they had been so well
received—of soft-hearted little Gredel, who had wept so
freely at seeing them depart.</p>

<p>When the smoky roofs of Saverne and the weathercock
of the church had disappeared behind the mountain,
Coucou Peter at length shook off the deep reverie
in which he had been indulging, and after two or three
times clearing his voice, he gravely chanted the old
ballad of ‘The Count of Geroldsek:’ the yellow dwarf
keeping watch on the highest tower, the deliverance of
the fair Itha, held captive at Haut-Bârr. There was
something melancholy in Coucou Peter’s voice, for he
was thinking of his little Gredel. Bruno’s step was in
cadence; and to the mind of Mathéus, listening to this
old language, returned dim and vague memories.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
After the last verse Coucou Peter took breath, and
cried—</p>

<p>“What a jolly life these Counts of Geroldsek led!—going
about the mountain, carrying off girls, fighting
husbands—drinking, singing, feasting, from morning
till night! What a glorious existence! The king himself
wasn’t fit to be their cousin!”</p>

<p>“Doubtless—doubtless, the Counts of Geroldsek were
great and powerful nobles,” replied Mathéus. “Their
authority extended from the county of Bârr to Sûngau,
and from Lower Mundat to Bassigny, in Champagne;
the richest jewels, the most beautiful arms, the most
magnificent hangings, belonged to their sumptuous
castles in Alsace and Lorraine; the most exquisite wines
filled their cellars, numerous knights rode under their
banners, crowds of gentlemen and valets attended upon
them in their courts—some monks also, whom they
held in great esteem. Unfortunately, instead of practising
anthropo-zoological virtues, these noble personages
destroyed travellers on the highway; and the
Being of Beings, weary of their rapine, has made them
descend in the rank of animals.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Coucou Peter, laughing, “it seems to
me that I must once have been one of those good monks
you have just been speaking about. I must try and
find out, the first time I go by Geroldsek.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean to do that?”</p>

<p>“I shall go up to the castle, and if ever I have been
one of those good monks, I shall find out the road to
the cellar at once.”</p>

<p>While deploring the sensual tendencies of his disciple,
Mathéus inwardly laughed at his gay humour. “One
cannot be perfect,” he said to himself. “This poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
Coucou Peter thinks only of satisfying his physical
appetites; but he is so good a fellow that the Great
Demiourgos will not be offended with him; he will even
laugh, I think, at the idea of the monk and his proof
of the cellar of Geroldsek!” And the illustrious philosopher
shook his head, as much as to say, “He’ll never
change! He’ll never change!”</p>

<p>Chatting in this manner, they made their way quietly
along by the Zorn. For more than an hour they had
kept to the other side of the road, so as to be within
the shade of the trees, for the sun was high, and the
heat overpowering. As far as the eye could reach
nothing was to be seen on the immense plain of Alsace
but waving fields of rye, wheat, and oats; the hot air
was laden with the scent of long grass. But the eye
turned involuntarily towards the river, under the
shadow of the old willows dipping their long branches
in the water, and the thought arose, of what delight it
would be to bathe in the fresh and limpid waves!</p>

<p>Towards noon, Frantz Mathéus and his disciple
halted near a spring surrounded with alders, at a little
distance off the road. They unsaddled Bruno. Coucou
Peter put his flask of wolxheim to cool in the spring;
he then produced the provisions from his haversack, and
lay down beside his master, between two ridges of oats,
which completely sheltered them from the heat of the
day.</p>

<p>It is a delicious sensation, after the fatigue and dust
of the road, to rest in the shade, to hear the gush of
water through the grass, to watch the thousands of insects
passing above one’s head in joyous caravans, and to
feel the great golden heads of the corn rustling about one.</p>

<p>Bruno browsed along the hedge; Coucou Peter raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
himself upon his elbow with indescribable satisfaction,
clicked his tongue, and now and then presented the
flask to Mathéus; but it was only for form’s sake, for
the illustrious philosopher preferred spring-water to the
best wine, especially during such heat. At last the gay
fiddler finished his meal, closed his pocket-knife, and
cried with a satisfied air—</p>

<p>“All goes well, Maître Frantz; it is clear the Great
Demiourgos protects us—clear as day! We’re far from
Saverne; and if that beggar of a procureur lays hold of
us now, I’ll consent to be hanged at once. Let us now
take a last pull at the flask, and get on our way; for if
we arrive too late, the gates of the city will be closed.”</p>

<p>Saying that, he replaced his haversack, presented the
bridle to Mathéus, and the illustrious philosopher having
bestridden Bruno, they went forward, full of courage
and confidence. The great heat was passed, the shadow
of the neighbouring hills began to stretch across the
road, and the Rhine breeze to refresh the air.</p>

<p>At every village, however, Coucou Peter remembered
that he had still three francs left of the thirty given
him by Dame Thérèse, and made a visit to the nearest
wine-shop. Everywhere he fell in with acquaintances,
and found a pretext for offering or accepting a bottle.
But it was in vain that he begged his master to enter
the public-houses; for Mathéus, seeing that in this
manner they could never get to the end of their destination,
remained on horseback at the door, in the midst
of a circle of peasants who collected to look at him.
The most he would do was to accept a glass through the
window, in token of good-fellowship with the numerous
friends of his disciple.</p>

<p>At length, towards evening, they came in sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
ancient city of Strasbourg. Great animation had already
exhibited itself on their passage; every moment they
met carriages, waggoners leading their horses by the
bridle, customs officers, armed with their sharp iron
probe, pricking packages, and diligences filled with conscripts.</p>

<p>A crowd of lights appeared in the distance, and repeated
themselves in the dark stream of the Ile. But
when they had made their way across the bridge, and
through the crowded and noisy corps de garde, and the
winding outworks; when they had penetrated into the
city, with its old houses, their fronts falling into decay,
their thousand windows gleaming in the light of the
hanging lamps; its silk-mercers and sweetstuff-shops
and library illuminated as if by magic-lanterns; street-doors
blocked up with merchandise, tortuous alleys
hiding away in the darkness; when all these objects
met their view, what tenderly affecting thoughts returned
to the good Doctor’s memory!</p>

<p>Here he had spent the happiest years of his youth;
here was the Heron beerhouse where every evening, on
leaving the medical lecture-room, he came to smoke his
pipe and take a pint of beer in company with Ludwig,
Conrad, Bastien, and many other joyous comrades.
There it was that the seignor perorated gravely in the
midst of his subject Burchen; that the pretty waitresses
moved about them, laughing with one, replying with a
wink to another, and answering the orders of their
mistress with, “Coming directly, madame.” Ah, happy
days, how far off now! What has become of you, Conrad,
Wilhelm, Ludwig, brave drinkers that you were?—what
has become of you these forty years? And you,
Gretchen, Rosa, Charlotte, what has become of you?—you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
so fresh, so graceful, so active, who used to worry
little Frantz, sitting always so grave at the corner of
the table, smoking calmly and sipping his beer, with
his eyes raised to the ceiling, dreaming already, perhaps,
of his sublime anthropo-zoological discoveries?
What has become of you, youth, grace, beauty, life
without care, and with unbounded hope? Ah, you are
far, far off! And you, poor Mathéus! have grown old;
your locks are grey, you have nothing left but your
system to sustain you.</p>

<p>Thus the good man meditated, his heart beating, and
the crowd, the vehicles, the shops, and edifices about
him having no power to draw him from his recollections.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the aspect of the spot he was
passing changed the current of his melancholy musing:
there, by the custom-house, under the roof of that high
house, reflected in the Ile, and looking down upon the
passing boats, was his garret-chamber; his little ink-stained
deal table, his bed hung with blue curtains in the
recess, and he, Frantz Mathéus, young, with his elbows
on an ancient folio spread before a solitary candle, studying
the principles of the learned Paracelsus, who places
the soul in the stomach; of the profound La Caze, who
fixes it in the tendonous centre of the diaphragm; of the
judicious Ernest Platner, who makes it drawn in with
the atmosphere by the lungs; of the sublime Descartes,
who incloses it in the pineal gland—of all those great
masters of human thoughts. Yes, he again saw all this,
and smiled gently; for since then how many precious
facts, how many learned discoveries, had been stored in
his mind!</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said to himself, “if the body exhausts
itself and becomes feeble, the intelligence develops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
itself every day. Eternal youth of the soul, which
cannot grow old, and completes itself by successive
transformations!”</p>

<p>Still farther on was the dwelling of Louise—of good,
innocent Louise—who span, singing a simple air, while
he, Mathéus, seated on a stool at her feet, gazed on
her for entire hours, murmuring, “Louise, do you
truly love me?” And she would answer, “You know
well, Frantz, that I love you.” Oh, sweet memories!
can all have been but a dream?</p>

<p>The good man gave himself up to the charm of these
distant recollections; he seemed still to be hearing
Louise’s spinning-wheel humming in the silence, when
the voice of Coucou Peter scattered his charming
illusions.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Maître Frantz?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Where duty calls us,” replied Mathéus.</p>

<p>“Yes, but to what place?”</p>

<p>“To wherever is most proper for the propagation of
the doctrine.”</p>

<p>They had reached the Rue des Arcades, and halted
under a lamp.</p>

<p>“Are you not hungry, Maître Frantz?” inquired
Coucou Peter.</p>

<p>“Slightly, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Like me,” said the disciple, scratching his ear;
“the Great Demiourgos ought to send us a supper.”</p>

<p>Mathéus looked at Coucou Peter; he had not in the
least the appearance of jesting, and this fact made
Mathéus himself very serious.</p>

<p>For more than a quarter of an hour they watched
the people passing through the arcades—sellers crying
their wares, pretty girls stopping at the shop-windows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
students jingling their spurs on the pavement and
smacking their riding-whips, grave professors making
their way through the crowd, with packets of books
under their arms.</p>

<p>At length Coucou Peter said—</p>

<p>“I think, Maître Frantz, the Being of Beings has
forgotten us at the present moment. By my faith,
we should do no harm to go and earn a few sous in the
beershops, instead of waiting till He sends us a supper.
If you knew how to sing, I should say come in with
me; but as it is, I’ll go in alone, and you can wait for
me at the door.”</p>

<p>This proposition appeared very humiliating to Mathéus,
but not knowing what answer to make, he resigned
himself, and followed his disciple, who went up
the Grande Rue and took his violin out of its bag.</p>

<p>Nothing could be sadder to see than the good Doctor
going from public-house to public-house, and watching
through the window his disciple dancing sometimes on
one leg, sometimes on the other, to support the doctrine.
He was obliged to remind himself of his high mission,
and say to himself that the Being of Beings wished to
test his courage before raising him to the highest experience
of glory; he did not fail to despise the rich warehouses,
the magnificent displays, the luxury and
opulence about him, crying to himself—</p>

<p>“Vanitas vanitatum, est omnia vanitas! Your pride
is but as dust, O great ones of the earth! You will
pass away like shadows, and be as if you had never
been!”</p>

<p>All these sublime truths served very little purpose;
and, to add to the distress, Bruno was strongly inclined
to enter every inn he came to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>They stopped before more than twenty taverns, and
towards nine o’clock Coucou Peter had yet but five
sous in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he said, “things are going wrong; here
are three sous, if you like to take a glass; for myself, I
shall go and buy a loaf, for my stomach is getting
emptier every moment.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Coucou Peter—thanks!” replied the good
man, very sadly. “I am not thirsty; but listen to me.
I recollect now that Georges Müller, the landlord of the
Heron hotel, made me promise never to put up at any
other house than his. It was on the last day of our
Fuchcommerce, our studies being finished. Georges
Müller, seeing that my comrades and I had paid up all
our debts, shook us by the hand, and offered us his
hotel if by chance any of us returned to Strasbourg.
The promise I remember as well as if it had been given
to-day, and it is my duty to keep my word.”</p>

<p>“How long ago was it?” inquired Coucou Peter, his
face lighting up with hope.</p>

<p>“Five-and-thirty years ago,” replied Mathéus, ingenuously.</p>

<p>“Five-and-thirty years!” cried Coucou Peter. “And
do you imagine that Georges Müller is still there?”</p>

<p>“No doubt. I observed his sign as I passed; nothing
has been changed.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, let us go to the Heron,” said the disciple,
with a downcast air. “If there’s nothing to be
gained there, there’s nothing to be lost! May the
Great Demiourgos come to our assistance!”</p>

</div>

<p>Nine o’clock was striking at the Cathedral when
Frantz Mathéus and his disciple stopped in front of the
Heron brewery. The great yard, shaded by lime-trees,
was full of company; a troop of gipsies accompanied
the tumult with their wild music. Kasper Müller, the
brewer, in his shirt-sleeves, went from table to table,
shaking hands and interchanging jocular greetings with
the drinkers; and all these figures, grave and comic,
hidden in the shade, or distinctly seen in the uncertain
light, presented a truly strange spectacle.</p>

<p>The illustrious philosopher, however, instead of giving
himself up to his habitual reflections on the affinities of
races, looked on all with a dull eye. It might have
been said, to see him with outstretched neck and
dangling legs, that he despaired of the doctrine, and of
the future of the generations to come.</p>

<p>“Come, Maître Frantz,” said Coucou Peter to him,
“courage! Go into your friend Georges Müller’s
house; he can’t fail to recognise you—then, hurrah!
If we can only find a lodging for to-night, to-morrow
we’ll convert the world!”</p>

<p>Mathéus obeyed mechanically; he alighted, buttoned
his brown greatcoat, and advanced with trembling steps
into the yard, casting undecided glances at all the
groups, and not knowing whom to address.</p>

<p>Presently Kasper Müller perceived him wandering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
under the roofs like a troubled spirit; the good man’s
face, stamped with sadness, interested him greatly. He
came forward to meet him, and inquired what he
needed.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” replied Mathéus, with a low bow, “will
you have the kindness to tell me where I can find
Georges Müller?”</p>

<p>“Georges Müller? He’s been dead these fifteen
years!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Is it possible to be more unfortunate
than I am?” cried the good man, in a choking
voice.</p>

<p>He bowed again, and was moving towards the gate;
but the brewer, touched by the sadness of this exclamation,
detained him, and taking him aside, said,
kindly—</p>

<p>“Excuse me, monsieur; you appear to be in some
pressing need. Can I not render you the service you
expected of Georges Müller?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” replied Mathéus, his eyes filling with
tears, “I am in pressing want. I came to ask a lodging
for the night of Georges Müller, one of my oldest and
dearest acquaintances. Though I have not seen him
for five-and-thirty years—the time at which I finished
my studies—I am sure his heart had not changed, and
that he would have given me a welcome.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it—I have no doubt of it,”
replied the brewer; “and I, his son, will not refuse it
to you, be sure of it.”</p>

<p>“You the son of Georges Müller!” cried Mathéus.
“You must be little Kasper, then, whom I have so
often rocked on my knees! Ah! my dear child, how
happy I am to see you again! I should not have recognised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
you, with those big whiskers and that great ruddy
face!”</p>

<p>Kasper could not help smiling at the doctor’s simplicity;
but, seeing a crowd of drinkers gathering about
them, he took him into the great dining-room, then
empty, to ascertain more exactly the state of his affairs.
Maître Frantz, without beating about the bush, informed
him under what circumstances he had quitted Graufthal,
and acquainted him with the innumerable vicissitudes
of his anthropo-zoological peregrinations; and Kasper
Müller, familiarly placing his hands on the Doctor’s
shoulders, cried—</p>

<p>“You are a good and excellent man! Does not your
name appear on the registry of my birth?”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” replied the illustrious philosopher;
“Maître Georges had me for a witness.”</p>

<p>“Eh! what need of further explanation is there?”
interrupted the brewer. “You will remain in my house
to-night, that’s understood. I’ll have your horse taken
to the stable, and send your disciple to you.”</p>

<p>This said, he quitted Mathéus to go and give his orders.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter had scarcely rejoined the illustrious
Doctor in the chief dining-room, before Charlotte, one
of the servants of the house, came to inform them that
all was ready. In spite of this agreeable news, Frantz
Mathéus could not help feeling deeply melancholy. It
seemed to him that the Great Demiourgos, instead of
leaving him to have recourse to Georges Müller, might
have given to him, himself, all things necessary to
philosophic existence, the more as it was solely for his
glory that he had left Graufthal without taking with
him a single sou.</p>

<p>But Coucou Peter, surprised at finding such a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
resting-place, instead of having to sleep under the stars,
was astonished at everything—at the size of the hotel,
at the stairs, furnished with a handsome copper hand-rail,
at the number of the rooms; and when Charlotte
conducted them into a neat room, and he saw on a
round table the supper already smoking, including half
a stuffed turkey, his gratitude expressed itself warmly.
“O Great Being!” he cried, “Being of Beings! now is
manifested thy boundless power and infinite wisdom!
What a banquet for poor devils of philosophers, who
expected to have to sleep in the street!”</p>

<p>He uttered these words in such an expressive tone of
voice that Charlotte instantly conceived an affection for
him; but the illustrious Doctor made no reply, for he
was truly downcast, and making sad reflections on the
philosophic career.</p>

<p>Reflecting that the greatest philosopher of modern
times, the successor of Pythagoras, of Philolaus, and all
the sages of India and Egypt, the illustrious Frantz
Mathéus of Graufthal, instead of being received by
the population with enthusiasm, of being borne in
triumph over roads strewn with palm, had run the
risk of having to lie in the street and of dying of
hunger, he became deeply melancholy, and while he
ate, bitterly recapitulated in his mind the events of
his journey; the beating he had received at Oberbronn,
Jacob Fischer’s attempt to seize Bruno, the threat of
the Procureur of Saverne, and the proposition of Coucou
Peter to go and sing in the beerhouses. This last circumstance
above all wounded him to the depths of his
soul, and every now and then large tears filled his eyes;
for he saw himself, like Belisarius, holding out his hand
for charity at a street-corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>Coucou Peter at first paid no attention to his distressed
aspect; but towards the end of the meal he perceived
it, and cried, as he set down his glass—</p>

<p>“What the deuce are you thinking of, Maître Mathéus?
I never saw you looking like this before!”</p>

<p>“I am thinking,” replied the good man, “that human
kind is unworthy to know the sublime truths of anthropo-zoology.
The peoples appear to me to be struck with a
deplorable—and I must say wilful—blindness; for if
they are blind, it is because they choose to be so. In
vain have we attempted to make them listen to the
voice of justice. In vain have we tried by eloquence
and persuasion to soften their hearts. In vain have we
sacrificed our dearest affections, quitted the roof of our
fathers, our friends, our——”</p>

<p>He was unable to finish; his heart, swelled more and
more by the enumeration of these calamities, ended by
stifling his voice; and, bowing his head upon the table,
he burst into tears.</p>

<p>At that moment Kasper Müller, having shut up the
brewery, for it was eleven o’clock, entered the room
with a bottle of old wolxheim in each hand. He was
struck by the sight of the Doctor’s distress.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” he said, stopping at the threshold,
“what has happened? Here I was coming to clink
glasses with an old friend of my father, and I find everybody
down in the mouth!”</p>

<p>Coucou Peter gave up his seat to him, and told him
the state of affairs.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” cried Kasper Müller. “Have you
reached your age, my dear monsieur, without having
learned what men are? Why, if I were to weep at all
the rascals to whom I have rendered services, and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
have repaid me with ingratitude, it would take me six
months to do it! Come, come, cheer up! What the
deuce! You are in the midst of good and trustworthy
friends. Come, drink a cup of this old wolxheim—it will
raise your spirits.”</p>

<p>Speaking in this manner, he filled the glasses, and
drank the illustrious philosopher’s health. But Frantz
Mathéus was too deeply affected to be so quickly consoled;
in spite of the excellence of the wolxheim, in
spite of the kind speeches of his host, and of Coucou
Peter’s encouragements, his soul remained oppressed
by an undefined sadness. It was not until later, when
Kasper Müller led the conversation on to the subject
of the good old times, that he appeared to recover
himself. With what delight the excellent old man
retraced the physiognomies of the past, the simplicity
of manners, the affectionate cordiality of the
old inhabitants of Strasbourg, the simple and patriarchal
family life! It became evident that all his affections,
his whole soul, his whole heart, took refuge in that
far-distant past.</p>

<p>Coucou Peter, with his elbow resting on the table,
gravely smoked his pipe; Kasper Müller smiled at the
good man’s recitals; and Charlotte, seated behind the
stove, fell asleep in spite of herself—her head bowing
slowly, slowly, and then, at intervals, recovering itself
with a jerk.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o’clock when Kasper Müller took
leave of his guest, and Charlotte, half asleep, conducted
Coucou Peter to a neighbouring chamber, and was able
to get to rest after her fatigues.</p>

<p>Left alone, Maître Frantz raised the curtain of his
window, and for some minutes contemplated the deserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
and silent streets of the city. The lamps were going
out—the moon cast her pale light on the chimneys; an
indescribable feeling of lonesomeness and sadness came
upon his soul; he felt as if he were alone in the world!
At length he went to bed, murmuring a prayer, and,
having fallen asleep, the fair valley of Graufthal was
brought back to him: he heard the rustling of the
foliage, and the blackbird singing in the shady alleys of
the pines. It was a beautiful dream!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

</div>

<p>The cries of the vegetable-sellers woke Frantz
Mathéus at an early hour. The city was still covered
with the Rhine mists, and heavy vehicles were rumbling
over the pavements.</p>

<p>What a difference from his little village of Graufthal,
so calm, so peaceful in its valley of pines!—where the
vague murmur of the foliage, the carolling of the birds,
and the merry chatting of neighbours on the thresholds
of their little cottages, hardly disturbed its matutinal
repose! How the least sighs, the smallest sounds, made
themselves distinctly heard there, in the midst of the
silence! How sweet it was to dream of the Great
Demiourgos until good old Martha brought him his
slippers!</p>

<p>Long did the illustrious philosopher, with his elbow
on the pillow, picture to himself this domestic happiness;
these tranquil mountain scenes, with their paths
half hidden in the heather; the soft murmur of the
Zinsel in its stony bed; the fisherman returning along
the river’s bank, his long rod and large net on his
shoulder; the poacher, moist with dew, his short gun
under his arm, returning at daybreak; the woodman in
his smoky hut, his axe in his waistbelt. Jean-Claude
Wachtmann himself, with his little three-cornered hat
and large nose, then appeared to him a privileged being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
of nature, enjoying immense—incalculable—happiness!
while he, poor exile, without hearth or home, repulsed
on all sides, having not even a stone to rest his head
upon, considered himself as the most unhappy, the
most outcast, of all the beings in the world! Ah! if
he had not that high mission to fulfil!—if he had not
been predestined from the beginning of the ages for the
destruction of sophistry and prejudice! But this
mission itself—what bitterness, what misfortune, what
deception, had it not brought upon him! Alas! poor
Mathéus! how could he accomplish it? Whither
should he go on leaving the brewery? What should
he do on the evening of that very day?</p>

<p>In the midst of these thoughts the good man dressed
himself, and slowly descending the stairs went into the
chief dining-room. When he entered the windows were
all open, the servants sprinkling and sweeping the floor.
Madame Müller was filling with fruit and slices of
bread the little baskets of her children, before sending
them to school. It was a scene of animation which
almost made him forget the difficulties of converting
the universe. Moreover, Kasper Müller and Coucou
Peter, seated at one of the little tables in the room,
greeted him gaily, and his spirits slightly rose.</p>

<p>“Good morning, my dear monsieur! What sort of
a night have you passed?”</p>

<p>“You are just in time for breakfast, Maître Frantz!”</p>

<p>“Take a seat, Doctor. Catherine, this is the gentleman
I told you of.”</p>

<p>“Most happy to see you, monsieur, and to know
you. My husband has told me so much that is good
of you.”</p>

<p>It was thus that the Doctor was received. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
pressed to take his seat at table, and Charlotte speedily
appeared with two pots containing the coffee and hot
milk.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the illustrious philosopher had once
more to remark the sensual spirit of his disciple; for as
Charlotte poured out the coffee Coucou Peter cried—</p>

<p>“Give me a great deal of coffee—I’ll tell you why.”</p>

<p>Mathéus made a sign to him to restrain his gluttony;
but that did not prevent him from calling out again—</p>

<p>“Give me a great deal of milk—I’ll tell you why.”</p>

<p>“Very well, monsieur—very well,” replied Charlotte,
filling the cup up to the brim; then placing the coffee-pots
on the table, and waiting to hear Coucou Peter’s
explanation.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you waiting for, my dear?” inquired
the gay fiddler.</p>

<p>“For you to tell me why you wanted a great deal of
coffee and a great deal of milk.”</p>

<p>“Ah!—it’s because I always put a great deal of
sugar in my cup,” he replied.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this answer, and Mathéus did
not venture to make any objection.</p>

<p>During breakfast, which passed gaily, the illustrious
philosopher had no time to reflect on his future projects;
but towards the end of the meal, remembering
that the time for departure was approaching, and still
not knowing where to go, the good man’s face became
again very serious.</p>

<p>Kasper Müller appeared to read to the bottom of his
soul.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he said, “you must make me a promise.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear friend, anything in my power to do for
you I will do with the greatest pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“Very well; that’s understood, then. Now, listen
to me. If you have to stay here longer, I beg that you
will take advantage of my table and lodging.”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz made a gesture as if about to rise, but
Kasper Müller, laying a hand upon his arm, said—</p>

<p>“Hear me out—you shall then answer me. A person
more or less makes no difference in my house.”</p>

<p>“Nor two neither,” added Coucou Peter; “where
there’s enough for three there’s enough for four.”</p>

<p>But Kasper Müller paid no attention to this remark,
and went on—</p>

<p>“I have your promise. Now, if you were to consult
me on your grand projects, I should tell you frankly,
that, in your place, I should return to Graufthal.”</p>

<p>Maître Frantz looked at his host with moistened eyes,
but made no reply. A great resolution was plainly
struggling in his heart.</p>

<p>“I should go to Graufthal,” repeated Kasper Müller,
forcibly: “in the first place, because I should be able to
do more good there than anywhere else; in the next
place, because men are not worth the trouble you are
taking for them; they either do not, or will not, understand
you, and God can always enlighten His children
when it pleases Him to do so; and, finally, because, in
your place, I should think I had earned the right of
resting myself.”</p>

<p>Kasper Müller spoke in a firm tone; every word he
uttered came from his heart. Maître Frantz became
pale and red by turns. He hid his face between his two
hands, and cried—</p>

<p>“Do you think I have done enough for human kind?—that
posterity will not reproach me?—that I have
fulfilled my duty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“Done enough! What philosopher can boast of
having done as much as you?—of having fulfilled his
duties like you—of having sacrificed everything for his
doctrine? Come, my dear and worthy friend, shed no
tears; when a man has behaved as you have, he has
nothing to weep for. The evidence of your own conscience
is all that you can require to sustain you.”</p>

<p>These kind words softened Maître Frantz’s anguish;
his tears fell unchecked, as if they poured from a spring;
he felt vanquished by fortune, and the judicious advice
of an honest man. But Coucou Peter, seeing that he
was about to lose his place of Chief Rabbi, struck his
fist and cried—</p>

<p>“But <i>I</i> say, we are sure to conquer the universe!
The best moment isn’t the time to choose for throwing
up the game. And the place of Chief Rabbi I was
promised—for you did promise it to me, Maître Frantz,
you can’t deny that!”</p>

<p>Mathéus made no reply; he had neither strength
nor courage to do so; but Kasper Müller, laying his
hand on the worthy fellow’s shoulder, said to him—</p>

<p>“I have a place for you, comrade—a place that will
suit you much better than that of Chief Rabbi. I have
a place of cellarman vacant—forty francs a month,
lodging, board, and the generosity of the customers.
Eh?—what say you?”</p>

<p>The fat round face of Coucou Peter expanded with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Ah, Maître Kasper, you have a way of taking
people on their weak side!”</p>

<p>“You renounce the dignity of Chief Rabbi, then?”
cried the brewer.</p>

<p>“Well—since Maître Frantz——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“No, no! you must decide the question for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ faith, then,” cried Coucou Peter, rising, “long
live the cellar! My proper place is there.”</p>

<p>As soon as his disciple had renounced the doctrine,
the illustrious philosopher breathed more freely; and,
raising his hands, he said—</p>

<p>“The Being of Beings has decided; His will be
done!”</p>

<p>These were his only words of regret; for, with the
thought that he should return to Graufthal, a joy as
great as it was complete descended to the depths of his
soul—a joy which no words can describe. As much
ardour as he had felt in quitting his village, he now
felt to return to it. The brewer’s wife joined with
Kasper Müller in representing to him that he stood in
need of one or two days’ rest; but that was a thing
impossible.</p>

<p>“I must go,” he said, walking about the room; “I
must go. Do not try to detain me, my dear lady; I
should be distressed to refuse you anything. The
destinies are accomplished! Coucou Peter, go and
saddle Bruno; go, Coucou Peter, the sooner you do it
the better. Ah, my dear friend, if you knew what a
load you have taken from my breast! For the last two
days I have hardly breathed; every step that took me
farther from Graufthal has overwhelmed me with sadness.
But I am going back!—thank Heaven, I am
going back to it!”</p>

<p>Maître Kasper, seeing him so decided, attempted no
further to dissuade him. He went out with Coucou
Peter, and helped him to saddle the horse. Maître
Frantz had followed and moved round them, unable to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
conceal his impatience. At length, seeing that all was
ready, the good man threw his arms warmly about
Maître Kasper’s neck, crying—</p>

<p>“O noble heart! worthy son of Georges Müller! I
shall never forget the services you have rendered me.
May the Being of Beings shed His blessings on you and
on your family!”</p>

<p>He also embraced Dame Catherine, then Coucou
Peter, who sobbed. At last he was setting foot in the
stirrup, with singular briskness, when he felt the tail of
his coat pulled, and at the same time Coucou Peter
slipped something into his pocket.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, my friend?” asked Maître
Frantz.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Doctor, nothing; only some earnest-money
my new master has given me. Now that you are no
longer a prophet you’ll want money. But remember
that your road is through Brumath, Wasselonne, and
Saverne; you must stop at the Corne d’Abondance;
and you must not let yourself be cheated by the landlords,
Doctor—you are too good.”</p>

<p>During this discourse Mathéus observed his disciple
with an air of inexpressible tenderness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Coucou Peter—Coucou Peter!” he cried,
“what a man you would be if the unhappy instincts of
the flesh had not such an empire over you! What
goodness of heart! What natural simplicity! What
a spirit of justice! You would be perfect!”</p>

<p>They once more embraced and wept anew.</p>

<p>At length the Doctor succeeded in getting into the
saddle and rode away, repeating—</p>

<p>“May the Being of Beings recompense you all! May
He shower his benefits upon you! Farewell!”</p>

</div>

<p>Frantz Mathéus followed the directions of Coucou
Peter, stopping at the different inns he had named on
his route, and paying his way, as became a man who was
no longer travelling in the interests of civilisation. He
went by Wasselonne, Marmoutier, Saverne; and the
next day reached the plain of Falberg, which slopes
towards Graufthal.</p>

<p>It was at the break of day that Maître Frantz
descended the mountain; the red cock of Christina
Bauner was raising his morning cry, and the good man,
at this well-known sound, wept with joy. Bruno went
forward at a walking pace and neighed gently, as much
as to say—</p>

<p>“Monsieur, there’s your village; don’t you recognise
these little paths, these tall furze-bushes, these great
trees? And, down yonder, those thatched roofs, wet
with the mist of the valley? It’s your village! Ah,
monsieur! how happy I am to see it again!”</p>

<p>And the good Doctor sobbed; he had dropped the
bridle on his horse’s neck and covered his face with his
two hands, unable to restrain his tears. Then he moved
them and gazed silently. The grey morning light, the
white vapours, the moss-covered rocks, the shrubs, the
odour of plants, the breeze—all spoke to his soul, and
the nearer he approached the more he admired this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
country. Everything appeared beautiful to him, as if
he had seen it for the first time—friendly, as if he had
passed a thousand existences with it.</p>

<p>“Dear Heaven,” he said, “how good you are, to allow
me to see my country again—my beloved country! I
did not know—in truth, I did not know—how much I
loved this country; these trees, these cottages, the
pretty Zinsel murmuring as it goes, the tall waving
pines—I have never known till now—no, I have never
known till now—how necessary all these are to my
life!”</p>

<p>The narrow path widened, turned and returned, as if
to show him all the beauty of the landscape, and
conduct him gently to his dwelling-place. At the end
of an hour he came into the sandy high road near the
wooden bridge at the beginning of the village. Bruno’s
hoofs sounded on the bridge, and the excellent beast
neighed in a louder tone.</p>

<p>Graufthal was still sleeping; only the red cock of
Christina Bauner redoubled his crowing. Mathéus
looked at the little windows, the wide hanging roofs,
the skylights stuffed with wisps of straw, the gratings
of the cellars. What an agreeable freshness came
from the river! New life already circulated in the
good man’s veins. At last, he was before his own door;
he alighted, cast a glance through the palings of his
little garden, and saw the dew pearling the magnificent
heads of his cabbages. How fresh, calm, and silent
was everything!</p>

<p>He tapped on the window-shutter—waited. Bruno
neighed. What would be the result? He listened;
somebody was crossing the room—the shutter-bar was
raised—the heart of Maître Frantz galloped! The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
shutter was pushed open—and Martha—good old
Martha—in her nightcap, leaned out.</p>

<p>“Ah, good heavens! It’s the Doctor! Ah!—is it
possible?”</p>

<p>And quickly—very quickly—the good woman
hastened to open the door.</p>

<p>Mathéus, seated on the bench by the door of his
cottage, wept like the Prodigal Son.</p>
